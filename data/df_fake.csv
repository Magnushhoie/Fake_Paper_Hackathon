This study designed to see the influence of gastrodin in a cell model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MRC-5 cells were treated by LPS, before which gastrodin was administrated. The effects of gastrodin were evaluated by conducting CCK-8, FITC-PI double staining, Western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA. Besides this, the downstream effector and signalling were studied to decode how gastrodin exerted its function. And dual-luciferase assay was used to detect the targeting link between miR-103 and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). LPS induced apoptosis and the release of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in MRC-5 cells. Pre-treating MRC-5 cells with gastrodin attenuated LPS-induced cell damage. Meanwhile, p38/JNK and NF-kappaB pathways induced by LPS were repressed by gastrodin. miR-103 expression was elevated by gastrodin. Further, the protective functions of gastrodin were attenuated by miR-103 silencing. And LRP1 was a target of miR-103 and negatively regulated by miR-103. The in vitro data illustrated the protective function of gastrodin in LPS-injured MRC-5 cells. Gastrodin exerted its function possibly by up-regulating miR-103 and modulating p38/JNK and NF-kappaB pathways. "

The study intends to study whether H4K12ac participates in regulating the carcinogenic effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on osteosarcoma (OS). The plasmids of pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-RasWT and pEGFP-K-RasG12V/T35S were transfected into MG-63 cells, the protein levels of H4K12ac and ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blot. Effects of H4K12ac on cell proliferation and migration of MG-63 cells were tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide solution (MTT), transwell, soft-agar colony formation and flow cytometry assays. Effect of H4K12ac on the transcription of ERK1/2 downstream genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR and ChIP assays. The involvements of HDAT6, HAT1 and MDM2 in cell proliferation and migration of MG-63 cells were finally studied. We found that H4K12ac was specifically down-regulated by Ras-ERK1/2 activation in MG-63 cells. H4K12ac suppressed Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell viability, colony formation and migration in MG-63 cells. Additionally, HDAC6 silence recovered Ras-ERK1/2-repressed H4K12ac expression, as well as inhibited the carcinogenic effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MG-63 cells. Besides, down-regulated H4K12ac induced by Ras-ERK1/2 was found to be associated with MDM2-mediated HAT1 degradation. In conclusion, these results testified that Ras-ERK1/2 signalling promoted the development of OS by mediating H4K12ac through MDM2-mediated HAT1 degradation. "

We measured the level of OGFRP1 in endometrial cancer tissues and evaluated the influences of OGFRP1 dysregulation on the tumour cell biological processes of endometrial cancer cells. Further, the regulatory relationships between OGFRP1 and miR-124-3p, between miR-124-3p and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) were, respectively, investigated. The interaction between OGFRP1 dysregulation and activation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway was revealed by Western blotting. OGFRP1 was up-regulated in endometrial cancer tissues and cells. OGFRP1 suppression inhibited the malignant behaviour (inhibited cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed cell migration and invasion) of the Ishikawa cells via negatively regulating miR-124-3p. SIRT1 was a target gene of miR-124-3p, and miR-124-3p regulated tumour growth and metastasis by the down-stream signal of SIRT1. Moreover, suppression of OGFRP1 restrained the activation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signals in the Ishikawa cells via miR-124-3p/SIRT1 axis. Our experiments revealed that upregulation of OGFRP1 may enhance the progression of endometrial cancer by regulating miR-124-3p/SIRT1 axis and by activating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway.

The impacts of PG on the tumour cell behaviours (including cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion) of SKOV3 cells were grabbed. The levels of NORAD in cancer tissues and cell lines were determined; afterwards, the impacts of abnormal expression of NORAD on the tumour cell behaviours of SKOV3 cells were assessed. Moreover, we explored whether NORAD modulated the level of STAT3 by competitively sponging miR-608, thus mediating the antineoplastic effects of PG on ovarian cancer cells. PG suppressed cell viability, enhanced apoptosis and lessened migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells. NORAD was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cells. Silencing of NORAD lessened cell viability, migration and invasion, but induced apoptosis of SKOV3 cells, whereas overexpression of NORAD had opposite effects. Moreover, PG decreased the expression of NORAD. Overexpression of NORAD reversed the effects of PG treatment on the cell biological performances of SKOV3 cells, which were further reversed after overexpression of miR-608 simultaneously. Furthermore, STAT3 was tested as a target gene of miR-608, and the impact of NORAD in PG-treated SKOV3 cells were through the miR-608-mediated STAT3. Our findings reveal that NORAD/miR-608/STAT3 axis is pivotal in mediating the antineoplastic impacts of PG on ovarian cancer cells, which may offer a novel explanation in the therapy of ovarian cancer.

This study was aimed to test the authenticity of the hypothesis. Uveal melanoma MP65 cells were transfected for expression of KRas mutated. H2A.X phosphorylation and ERK1/2 was measured, and transwell experiment was performed to examine the consequents of H2A.XY39ph on MP65 cells developing and migration. Regulatory relationship between H2A.XY39ph and ERK1/2 downstream genes were measured. Moreover, whether JMJD6 and MDM2 are involved in H2A.X phosphorylation was studied. Mutation of Ras activated ERK1/2 signalling and inhibited H2A.X phosphorylation at Y39. Silence of H2A.XY39ph contributed to the regulation of MP65 cells growth, migration and transcription of ERK1/2 downstream genes, including CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15 and CARD16.

Baicalin (BAI) is reported to possess various pharmacological including anti-inflammatory activities. This research explored the molecular mechanism by which BAI functions in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). HAECs were pretreated with BAI. Cell viability, apoptosis, and expressions of crucial proteins were respectively evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, and western blot. Productions of cytokines were respectively assessed employing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell transfection was utilized to alter miR-145 expression. The expressions of proteins participated in JNK and p38MAPK pathways were analyzed utilizing western blot. TNF-alpha inducement successfully evoked inflammatory injury in HAECs, exhibiting as prominently suppressed viability, while facilitated apoptosis and productions of cytokines. However, BAI pretreatment significantly ameliorated TNF-alpha-triggered inflammatory injuries. Besides, miR-145 expression was markedly inhibited by TNF-alpha inducement, while notably elevated by BAI pretreatment. Although miR-145 overexpression had no significant influence on apoptosis, miR-145 silence observably reversed BAI pretreatment-evoked protective influences on TNF-alpha-induced HAECs, as well as the inhibited impacts on the levels of key proteins involved in JNK and p38MAPK pathways.

However, the biological significance of SDC-1 in colorectal carcinoma is not yet clear. An objective of this study was to investigate the role of SDC-1 in colorectal carcinoma cells. METHODS: Expression of SDC-1 in colorectal carcinoma tissues was evaluated by Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot. After transfection with pcDNA3.1 or pc-SDC-1, the transfection efficiency was measured. Next, SW480, SW620 and LOVO cell viability, apoptosis, migration and adhesion were assessed to explore the effects of exogenous overexpressed SDC-1 on colorectal carcinoma. In addition, the influences of aberrant expressed SDC-1 in Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and rat sarcoma virus (Ras)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways were detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS: SDC-1 mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated in human colorectal carcinoma tissues. SDC-1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation via suppressing CyclinD1 and c-Myc expression, meanwhile stimulated cell apoptosis via increasing the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2-associated x (Bax) and Cleaved-Caspase-3. Additionally, SDC-1 overexpression restrained cell migration via inhibiting the protein expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and elicited cell adhesion through increasing intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Furthermore, SDC-1 overexpression suppressed JAK1/STAT3 and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK-related protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the evidence from this study suggested that SDC-1 suppressed cell growth, migration through blocking JAK1/STAT3 and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways in human colorectal carcinoma cells.

MEG3 was down-regulated during tube formation of HMEC-1 cells. MEG3 expression suppressed cells viability, migration and tube formation, while it induced apoptosis. MEG3 could bind with miR-147 and repress miR-147 expression. MiR-147 induced ICAM-1 expression, and contained ICAM-1 target sequences. The anti-atherogenic actions of MEG3 were inhibited by miR-147, and the anti-atherogenic actions of miR-147 suppression were also inhibited when ICAM-1 was overexpressed. Further, ICAM-1 overexpression showed activated roles in Wnt/beta-catenin and Jak/Stat signaling pathways.

However, the effects of vinculin on gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the functional role of vinculin in GC, as well as its underlying mechanism. Expression of vinculin in patients with GC was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Overall survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. The relationship between vinculin and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GC was further identified. In addition, we assessed the expression of vinculin in GC cell lines. Besides, vinculin was suppressed or overexpressed by transfection with small interfering (si-vinculin) or pcDNA-vinculin and then cell viability, cell apoptosis, and/or migration was respectively examined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometer, and scratch assay, respectively. Moreover, the cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The expression of vinculin was significantly increased in the GC tissues and cells compared with the nontumor tissues or cells. Vinculin protein positive staining was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Moreover, vinculin was significantly associated with Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) and poor differentiation. Patients with high vinculin levels had significantly worse overall survival than those with low levels. Suppression of vinculin significantly decreased cell viability and migration and promoted cell apoptosis. However, overexpression of vinculin statistically increased cell viability but had no effects on cell apoptosis.

Bifidobacterium (BIF) is one of the dominant bacteria in the intestines of humans and many mammals and is able to adjust the intestinal flora disorder. The Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) at 10 ng/ml for 24 h to induce the destruction of intestinal mucosal barrier system. Cells viability was detected through Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and the expression of apoptosis related proteins was also detected through Western blot. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was detected through ELISA, Western blot and qRT-PCR, respectively. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay was conducted to value the barrier function of intestinal mucosa. Cell autophagy and NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways associated proteins were examined through Western blot. In the absence of TNF-alpha treatment, cell viability and apoptosis showed no significant change. TNF-alpha decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis and BIF treatment mitigated the TNF-alpha-induced change. Then, we found that BIF treatment effectively suppressed TNF-alpha-induced overexpression of IL-6 and IL-8. Besides, the results of TEER assay showed that barrier function of intestinal mucosa which was destroyed by TNF-alpha was effectively recovered by BIF treatment. In addition, TNF-alpha induced autophagy was also suppressed by BIF. Moreover, TNF-alpha activated NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways were also blocked by BIF, SN50 and SB203580. Our present study reveals that BIF plays a protective role in TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells through NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways. "

The expression of miR-133a and presenilin 1 (PSEN1) in two GC cell lines, SGC-7901 and BGC-823, were inhibited and overexpressed by transient transfections. Thereafter, cell viability, migration, and apoptosis were measured by trypan blue exclusion assay, transwell migration assay, and flow cytometry assay, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify whether PSEN1 was a direct target of miR-133a. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were mainly performed to assess the expression changes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, and Notch pathway proteins. MiR-133a inhibitor significantly increased cell viability and migration, while miR-133a mimic decreased cell viability, migration, and induced apoptosis. miR-133a suppression accelerated transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induce EMT, as evidenced by upregulation of E-cadherin, and downregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug. Of contrast, miR-133a overexpression blocked TGF-beta1-induce EMT by altering these factors. PSEN1 was a direct target of miR-133a, and suppression of PSEN1 abolished the promoting functions of miR-133 suppression on cell growth and metastasis. Moreover, PSEN1 inhibition decreased Notch 1, Notch 2, and Notch 3 protein expressions. This study demonstrates an antigrowth and antimetastasis role of miR-133a in GC cells. Additionally, miR-133a acts as a tumor suppressor may be via targeting PSEN1. "

Quercetin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in many foods and drinks. Herein, we focused our investigation on the possible protective activity of quercetin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 lung fibroblasts. METHODS: Viability and apoptosis of WI-38 were respectively tested using CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression levels of microRNA-221 (miR-221), IL-6 and TNF-a in WI-38. ELISA was conducted to determine the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-a in culture supernatant of WI-38. miR-221 mimic was transfected to increase miR-221 expression. The protein levels of key molecules involving in cell apoptosis, inflammation, NF-kappaB and JNK pathways were assessed using western blotting. RESULTS: LPS stimulation caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 lung fibroblasts via suppressing cell viability, inducing cell apoptosis and enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a. Quercetin treatment mitigated the LPS-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 lung fibroblasts via enhancing cell viability, inhibiting cell apoptosis and reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a. Moreover, quercetin ameliorated LPS-caused up-regulation of miR-221 in WI-38. The effects of quercetin on LPS-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 were reversed by miR-221 overexpression. Furthermore, quercetin inactivated NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in LPS-treated WI-38 via down-regulation of miR-221. CONCLUSION: This research verified the protective effects of quercetin on lung fibroblasts inflammatory damage. We revealed that quercetin ameliorated LPS-caused inflammatory damage of WI-38 lung fibroblasts might be through down-regulation of miR-221 and inactivation of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. "

We aimed to explore the functional role of Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) in human RB cells and the underlying mechanisms. Human RB Y79 and RBL-13 cells were incubated with or without GRh2, followed by assessments of cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis using Cell Counting Kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, and flow cytometry assays. Meanwhile, expression levels of proteins associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as well as p53 were measured by Western blot analysis. The mRNA expression of cyclinD1, autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) and p53, and microRNA (miR)-638 expression were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Then, miR-638 was overexpressed in Y79 and RBL-13 cells followed by treatment with GRh2, and p53 and proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed. Results showed that Y79 and RBL-13 cells viabilities were significantly reduced by 20-50 muM GRh2. Cell proliferation was decreased, and cell apoptosis and autophagy were promoted by 30 muM GRh2 in Y79 and RBL-13 cells. GRh2 decreased miR-638 expression, up-regulated p53 expression, and reduced phosphorylated levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR. More experiments showed GRh2-induced alterations of p53, phospho (p)-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR were all reversed by miR-638 overexpression. The observations demonstrated that GRh2 functioned in cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy in Y79 and RBL-13 cells through miR-638-mediated up-regulation of p53 and inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

RESULTS: TRAF4 was up-regulated in EC tissues. Knockdown of TRAF4 induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and migration. However, TRAF4 overexpression increased cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, we found TRAF4 down-regulation repressed the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in Ishikawa and primary EC cells. We also found that Oct4 was a downstream factor of PI3K/AKT pathway and was positively regulated by TRAF4. TRAF4 might increase cell viability through PI3K/AKT/Oct4 pathway. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that TRAF4 might exert an oncogenic role in EC progress via its regulation of PI3K/AKT/Oct4 pathway. "

This study investigated the effects of lncRNA Mirt2 and miR-429 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injuries in PC12 cells. Serum samples were collected from 36 patients with SCI and the healthy controls. The expression of lncRNA Mirt2 in serum samples was measured by qRT-PCR. The in vitro model of SCI was established by treating PC12 cells with LPS. The effects of lncRNA Mirt2 and miR-429 on the cell model were evaluated by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, western blot, qRT-PCR, and ELISA.

Overexpression of lncRNA Mirt2 protected PC12 cells against LPS-induced injuries. Further studies found that lncRNA Mirt2 acted as the molecular sponge of miR-429 and miR-34a-5p. lncRNA Mirt2 did not protect PC12 cells when miR-429 was overexpressed. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of lncRNA Mirt2 on NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were abolished when miR-429 was overexpressed. lncRNA Mirt2 exerts protective effects in an in vitro model of SCI by down-regulating miR-429.

We found that sevoflurane significantly inhibited U2OS and Saos-2 cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, sevoflurane obviously inactivated PI3K/AKT pathway in U2OS and Saos-2 cells. Activator of PI3K/AKT pathway, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) notably weakened the effects of sevoflurane on U2OS and Saos-2 cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Besides, sevoflurane suppressed EMT process in U2OS and Saos-2 cells. To sum up, our results evidenced that sevoflurane exerted anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects on osteosarcoma cells by inactivating PI3K/AKT pathway. "

However, its role in nephroblastoma is poorly studied. Herein, we aimed to reveal the regulatory effects of TPL on human nephroblastoma cells (G-401 and WiT49) as well as the regulatory mechanism in G-401 cells. METHODS: Effects of TPL on cell viability, migration and apoptosis of G-401 and WiT49 cells were measured by CCK-8 assay, Boyden Chamber, and flow cytometry/Western blot analysis, respectively. Expression of miR-193b-3p in TPL-treated G-401 and WiT49 cells was determined by RT-qPCR. Then, whether miR-193b-3p was the downstream factor of TPL was studied. Alteration of KLF4 expression in TPL-treated cells and the relationship between miR-193b-3p and KLF4 were assessed by Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Effects of abnormally expressed KLF4 on G-401 cells were also assessed. Finally, the involvements of PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways were measured by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: TPL reduced cell viability and migration while promoted apoptosis in G-401 and WiT49 cells. miR-193b-3p level was up-regulated by TPL stimulation, and TPL might function through regulation of miR-193b-3p. KLF4 expression was down-regulated by TPL, and KLF4 was proven to be a target gene of miR-193b-3p. TPL mediated the repressive roles in growth of nephroblastoma cells via KLF4 knockdown. Finally, we found phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and ERK was inhibited by TPL, possibly through miR-193b-3p-mediated regulation of KLF4. CONCLUSION: TPL showed a tumor suppressive role in nephroblastoma cells via miR-193b-3p-mediated down-regulation of KLF4, along with inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways. "

","BACKGROUND: Ailanthone (AIL) is a quassinoid isolated from traditional Chinese herbal medicine Ailanthus altissima. The anti-tumor activities of AIL have been reported in various solid tumors. This study aimed to reveal the in vitro effect of AIL on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: The effects of AIL on five AML cell lines (KG1, HL60, U-937, THP-1 and OCI-AML2) as well as myeloid progenitor cells were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay and Western blotting. KG1 and HL60 cells were transfected with miR-449a inhibitor or its negative control, and then were treated by AIL. The above mentioned assays were performed again to study the involvement of miR-449a in AIL's function. RESULTS: AIL dose-dependently inhibited the viability of AML cells and myeloid progenitor cells. The IC50 value of AIL towards KG1 and HL60 cells was 0.58 and 0.57 muM, respectively. AIL with concentration of 0.5 muM significantly induced the apoptosis of AML cells rather than myeloid progenitor cells. Meanwhile, 0.5 muM AIL significantly reduced migration and invasion of AML cells. miR-449a was highly expressed in response to the treatment of 0.5 muM AIL. Besides this, the anti-tumor activities of AIL in AML cells were attenuated by miR-449a silence. Further, the blockage of Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways induced by AIL was reversed by miR-449a silence. CONCLUSION: AIL restrained AML cells growth, migration and invasion through up-regulation of miR-449a, and deactivation of Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. "

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effect and associated mechanisms of APS on LPS-induced injury in ATDC5 cells, to evaluate the potential of APS for use as an adjuvant therapy for osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ATDC5 cells were pre-treated with APS and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell viability, ROS generation as well as the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, iNOS and Cox-2 were evaluated by performing CCK8 assay, ROS detection, ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR. The expression of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways related proteins and KLF4 was measured through western blot.

APS treatment significantly alleviated LPS-induced damage in ATDC5 cells. Besides, miR-92a was down-regulated while KLF4 was up-regulated by APS. At the same time, the targeting relationship between miR-92a and KLF4 was demonstrated. The inhibitory effects of APS on LPS-induced injury in ATDC5 cells were attenuated by the combination of KLF4 siRNA. In addition, LPS induced NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways were decreased by APS treatment. Also, the inhibitory effect of APS on NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways was reversed by KLF4 siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that APS protects ATDC5 cells against LPS induced-injury by regulation of miR-92a/KLF4 axis and suppressing NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signal pathways. "

We detected the geniposide (GEN) in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. METHODS: HepG2 and Huh7 cells were individually induced with GEN dilutions, and then they were transfected with microRNA (miR)-224 overproduction vector (miR-224 mimic) as well as the corresponding negative control (NC). Cell viability was detected with the CCK-8. The apoptotic rate was determined by the Annexin V-FITC/PI with flow cytometer. The migration or invasion rates were separately determined by migration assay or millicell hanging cell culture. The expression of miR-224 was quantified depending on qRT-PCR. Relative proteins were individually determined via western blot. RESULTS: GEN treatment induced inhibition of HepG2 and Huh7 cells proliferation, migration and invasion but promotion of apoptosis. miR-224 was down-regulated by GEN. Transfection of miR-224 mimic led to high expression of miR-224, which partly rescued cancer cells survival by prohibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, the production of Wnt/beta-catenin and AKT proteins was notably reduced by GEN but increased by overexpressed miR-224. CONCLUSION: GEN played anti-tumor roles by targeting miR-224 via blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin and AKT cascades in the HepG2 and Huh7 cells. "

Here, we aimed to ascertain the anti-inflammatory role of NG-R1 in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) as well as the possible mechanism which is still under to be elucidated. METHODS: In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was applied to evoke extreme inflammation in ATDC5 cells. To investigate the anti-inflammatory property of NG-R1, ATDC5 cells were exposed to NG-R1 prior to LPS stimulation. microRNA-301a (miR-301a)-overexpressed ATDC5 cells were established which confirmed by qRT-PCR. Then, inflammatory lesions were indicated by cell viability, apoptosis and inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway was determined by Western blotting assay. RESULTS: We found NG-R1 dramatically dampened the decrease of cell viability, facilitation of apoptosis and abundance of inflammatory factors induced by LPS. Additionally, NG-R1 pre-incubation impeded LPS-induced accumulation of miR-301a. However, the protective capacity of NG-R1 was impaired by miR-301a overexpression. Of note, LPS-caused phosphorylation of p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B alpha (IkappaBalpha) was repressed by NG-R1, while further enhanced in miR-301-transfected ATDC5 cells. CONCLUSION: NG-R1 relived LPS-elicited inflammatory damages via blocking NF-kappaB in a miR-301a-silenced manner. "

In this study, we investigated the effects of microRNA-132 (miR-132) dysregulation on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced apoptosis in fetal rat hippocampal neurons, in order to reveal the therapeutic potential of miR-132 on HIBI. MiR-132 dysregulation was induced prior to OGD exposure by transfection of primary fetal rat hippocampal neurons with miR-132 mimic or miR-132 inhibitor. The effects of miR-132 overexpression and suppression on OGD-stimulated hippocampal neurons were evaluated by detection of cell viability, apoptotic cells rate, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Besides, TargetScan database and dual luciferase activity assay were used to seek a target gene of miR-132. As a result, miR-132 was highly expressed in hippocampal neurons following 2 h of OGD exposure. MiR-132 overexpression significantly increased OGD-diminished cell viability and reduced OGD-induced apoptosis at 12, 24, and 48 h post-OGD. MiR-132 overexpression significantly down-regulated the expressions of Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-9, but up-regulated BCl-2. Caspase-3 activity was also significantly decreased by miR-132 overexpression. Furthermore, FOXO3 was a direct target of miR-132, and it was negatively regulated by miR-132. To conclude, our results provide evidence that miR-132 protects hippocampal neurons against OGD injury by inhibiting apoptosis. "

Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) functions by relieving inflammatory damage.Objective: We aimed to investigate the mechanism by which AS-IV protects ATD cells from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage.Materials and methods: ATDC5 cells were transfected with miR-203 inhibitor and NC inhibitor (150 nM) or pEX-MyD88 and sh-MyD88 (50 nM) for 48 h, pre-treated by 15 mug/mL AS-IV for 24 h, then treated by 5 mug/mL LPS for 12 h. Dual-luciferase activity testing was used to determine whether miR-203 could bind to MyD88. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to detect cell activity and apoptosis, respectively, and qRT-PCR, western blots, and ELISA were performed to detect expression levels of miR-203 and inflammatory cytokines.Results: Based on the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50), there was no significant difference of AS-IV (0 to 15 mug/mL) on cell viability. Fifteen mug/mL was the optimal concentration of AS-IV in treating LPS-induced inflammatory damage in subsequent experiments since this was a semi-lethal concentration. AS-IV significantly reduces LPS-induced viability, apoptosis and the release of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and iNOS mainly through up-regulating miR-203. Further, MyD88 was a target gene of miR-203 and negatively regulated by miR-203.

Studies have ascertained that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) exert protective activities against oxidative damages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of GTP against H2O2-caused injuries in PC12 cells as well as the molecular underpinnings associated with long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1). PC12 cells were preincubated with GTP prior to H2O2 stimulation. Furthermore, MALAT1-deficient PC12 cells were constructed by transfection and identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Next, viability and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Meanwhile, Western blot assay was carried out to monitor the expression alteration of proteins associated with apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, pro-Caspase-3/9, and cleaved Caspase-3/9) and autophagy (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, LC3-I, Beclin-1, and p62). Moreover, we examined the expression of beta-catenin and dissected the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT). We found that H2O2 decreased the viability of PC12 cells while initiated apoptosis and autophagy processes. GTP-preincubated PC12 cells maintained the viability and resisted the apoptosis and autophagy induced by H2O2. Pointedly, GTP-pretreated PC12 cells showed an increase in MALAT1 after H2O2 stimulation. Of note, the protective effects of GTP were buffered in MALAT1-deficient cells in response to H2O2. The expression of beta-catenin and phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT were upregulated by GTP, while MALAT1 knockdown led to opposite results. To sum up, GTP protected PC12 cells from H2O2-induced damages by the upregulation of MALAT1. This process might be through activating Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT signal pathways. "

Viability and apoptosis were evaluated utilizing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines' mRNA expression and production were assessed by western blot and ELISA. Western blot was utilized to distinguish apoptosis and immune-related factors expression. Sequentially, the abovementioned parameters were reassessed when miR-429 was overexpressed. LPS declined viability as well as raised apoptosis and inflammatory injury in H9c2 cells. SW alleviated apoptosis and inflammatory injury induced by LPS. MiR-429 expression was elevated by LPS and suppressed by SW. SW-induced the increasing of viability and the reduction of inflammatory injury were reversed by overexpression of miR-429.

Thereafter, cell viability, cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, and expression of FOLR1, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2 (ABCG2) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) were analyzed. We found that miR-29b was significantly decreased, while FOLR1 was statistically elevated in colon cancer samples and cell lines compared to the nontumor samples and nontumourigenic immortalized human colon epithelial cell line FHC. Overexpression of miR-29b markedly inhibited cell viability, promoted sensitivity to L-OHP, stimulated cell apoptosis (all p < .05), and decreased the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp in cancer cells, whereas suppression of miR-29b showed contrary results. Moreover, we observed that FOLR1 was a direct target of miR-29b and was negatively regulated by miR-29b. In addition, the findings revealed that the effects of FOLR1 inhibition on cell viability, sensitivity to L-OHP, cell apoptosis, and the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp were similar to overexpression of miR-29b.

Activation of STAT3 is closely related with tumor development. We intended to study the effects of JMJD6 on phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 site. METHODS: Osteosarcoma cancer cell lines (Saos-2, MG-63, and HOS) and clinical specimens were obtained. Interference RNA or JMJD6 mimic was transfected into the cells to silence or mimic JMJD6. Immunoprecipitation assay and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down was implemented to investigate whether JMJD6 is associated with STAT3. STAT3-null HOS cells were simultaneously transfected with the plasmids bearing STAT3WT or STAT3Y705F and EGFP-tagged LC3 plasmids. Recombinant full-length JMJD6 protein was subjected to in vitro kinase activity assay for testing its ability to phosphorylate STAT3. The severity of autophagy was indicated by the number of autophagosomes, expression of EGFP-LC3, ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, degradation percentage of long-lived proteins and expression of autophagy associated gene (ATG). RESULTS: JMJD6 modulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 site in osteosarcoma cells. Results from immunoprecipitation and GST pull down assays showed that JMJD6 associated with STAT3 in osteosarcoma cells. JMJD6 silence impeded the formation of autophagosomes, inhibited the accumulation of EGFP-LC3, decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, blocked the degradation of long-lived proteins, and repressed the expression of ATG.

Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2 O2 for 24 hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

Silence of HEIH significantly reduced Huh7 and Hep3B cells viability, migration, and invasion, but induced apoptosis. It was coupled with the downregulated CyclinD1, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-8, Vimentin, the upregulated p53, Bax, as well as the cleaved caspase-3. MicroRNA (miR)-199a-3p was identified as a downstream effector of HEIH, as its expression was upregulated by HEIH silence, and the functional effects of HEIH on Huh7 and Hep3B cells were all attenuated when miR-199a-3p expression was suppressed. Furthermore, HEIH silence suppressed the activation of mTOR signaling via upregulating miR-199a-3p. CONCLUSION: HEIH silence might be a promising target for suppressing HCC cells growth and metastasis. Silence of HEIH exerted its antitumor properties possibly through upregulating miR-199a-3p, and thereby blockage of mTOR signaling. "

In this study, we firstly examined the expression level of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR) in homocysteine (Hcy)-stimulated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), and then looked into the potential molecular signaling axis of linc-ROR in regulating the proliferation and migration of HASMCs. Hcy promoted HASMC proliferation and up-regulated linc-ROR expression. Functional studies showed that linc-ROR exerted enhanced actions on the proliferation and migration of HASMCs. In addition, linc-ROR acted as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-195-5p and repressed the miR-195-5p expression in HASMCs.

Studies found circular RNA-SMAD2 (circSMAD2) impedes EMT by regulating microRNA (miR). Here, we intended to investigate the role of circSMAD2-miR-9 node in prostate cancer cells. Tissue specimens were procured from 20 patients with prostate cancer. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were transfected with the plasmid bearing circSMAD2 or miR-9 mimic. circSMAD2 and miR-9 were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cells were subjected to assays for viability, proliferation, and migration. EMT process was evaluated by investigating the phosphorylation of SMAD2, alteration of cadherin switch, and accumulation of vimentin. STAT and MEK/ERK pathways were then determined by Western blot. We found that the tumor tissues showed a decrement in circSMAD2. Restoration of circSMAD2 inhibited the proliferative and migratory activities, and impaired EMT process of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, circSMAD2-overexpressed cells showed a decrease in miR-9. Upregulating miR-9 abolished the inhibitory role of circSMAD2 in proliferation, migration, and EMT. Furthermore, circSMAD2 abated the phosphorylation of STAT3, MEK, and ERK, while miR-9 mimic rehabilitated the phosphorylated expression. In conclusion, miR-9 inhibition is required for circSMAD2 to abate migration and EMT process in prostate cancer cells. "

Cell activity, proliferation, migration, and incursion were tested through cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, flow cytometry, transwell, and BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers, separately. Expression of circMTO1 and other relative factors was tested through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. qRT-PCR revealed that circMTO1 expression was notably reduced in rectal cancer tissues. Overexpression of circMTO1 was established in SW837 and SNU-61 cells.

Inflammation plays vital roles in the progression of burn injury, and our study investigated whether notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) alleviated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human keratinocyte HaCaT cell inflammatory injury. Inflammatory injury was induced by LPS in HaCaT cells. Stimulated cells were then treated by NGR1 in different concentrations. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The accumulated levels of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 and caspase-9), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signal pathways-related proteins (p65, IkappaBalpha, and p38MAPK), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) were examined by western blot. Transfection was used to alter the expression of MyD88. We found that LPS stimulated HaCaT cells and induced cell inflammation, evidenced by decreasing cell viability, increasing cell apoptosis, and elevating TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions. Then, we found that NGR1 reversed the results by enhancing cell viability, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions. In addition, NGR1 decreased the phosphorylation of p65, IkappaBalpha, and p38MAPK, which increased by LPS. Moreover, NGR1 negatively regulated the expression of MyD88, and transfection with pMyD88 led to the opposite results with what showed by NGR1 in LPS-stimulated HaCaT cells.

However, the effect of BAI on diabetes mellitus has not been investigated. This study explored the antidiabetic effect of BAI on pancreatic beta-cell line Min6. Min6 cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to mimic beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The effects of BAI on viability and apoptosis of Min6 cells were analyzed by the cell counting kit-8 assay and Annexin V-fluoresceine isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining method. The insulin secretion of Min6 cells was determined using radioimmunoassay. Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and nuclear factor KappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Relative microRNA-205 (miR-205) expression was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. TNF-alpha treatment inhibited cell growth and insulin secretion, but promoted iNOS expression. All of these effects were reversed by BAI treatment. BAI promoted viability; suppressed apoptosis; regulated caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein; decreased iNOS level; and increased insulin production. BAI protected Min6 cells by upregulating miR-205. Besides, the Min6 cell-protective effect of BAI was PI3K/AKT pathway and NF-kappaB pathway dependent. BAI activated the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway by regulating miR-205. In conclusion, BAI protected Min6 cells from TNF-alpha-induced injury by upregulating miR-205, which acts, at least in part, via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway.

Triptolide (TPL) is the major active component extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. This study aimed to explore the effects of TPL on medulloblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, as well as the underlying possible molecular mechanism. Viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of Daoy cells were measured using cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and Guava Nexin assay, respectively. Cell migration was detected using two-chamber transwell assay and wound healing assay. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the relative expression of microRNA-138 (miR-138) in Daoy cells. Cell transfection was used to change the expression of miR-138 in cells. Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of key factors involved in cell apoptosis, cell migration, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase 3 (AKT) pathway, and the Notch pathway in Daoy cells. We found that TPL significantly inhibited the viability, proliferation, and migration of Daoy cells but promoted Daoy cell apoptosis. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 after TPL treatment were decreased. The expression of miR-138 in Daoy cells after TPL treatment was increased. Suppression of miR-138 obviously reversed the TPL-induced Daoy cell proliferation, migration inhibition, and cell apoptosis enhancement, as well as the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways. Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was a direct target gene of miR-138, which might be involved in the antitumor effects of TPL on Daoy cells. In conclusion, our study verified that TPL exerted anticancer effects on medulloblastoma cells possibly via upregulating miR-138 and inactivating the PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways. "

Similarly, inflammatory factors and signalling related proteins were also determined by western blot. Results: Emodin increased cell viability and diminished apoptosis in LPS-treated HaCaT cells. Moreover, cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 were all downregulated by emodin. Furthermore, inflammatory factors IL-1beta, IL-6, Cox-2 and iNOS were inhibited by emodin in LPS-treated cells. In addition, emodin decreased phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaBalpha and the level of PTEN while enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. Importantly, emodin increased expression of miR-21 suppressed by LPS and miR-21 downregulation negated the protective functions of emodin.

CONCLUSIONS: MiR-132 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD via regulation of cell apoptosis and GTDC-1/CDK-5/Tau phosphorylation signaling mechanism. It may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD. "

Nevertheless, whether H3K18ac participates in regulating Ras-ERK1/2-affected lung cancer cell phenotypes remains unclear. Objective: We explored the effects of H3K18ac on Ras-ERK1/2-affected lung cancer cell phenotypes. Material and methods: NCI-H2126 cells were transfected with, pEGFP-K-RasWT and pEGFP-K-RasG12V/T35S plasmids for 48 h, and transfection with pEGFP-N1 served as a blank control. Then H3K18ac and AKT and ERK1/2 pathways-associated factors were examined. Different amounts of the H3K18Q (0.5, 1, and 2 mug) plasmids and RasG12V/T35S were co-transfected into NCI-H2126 cells, cell viability, cell colonies and migration were analyzed for exploring the biological functions of H3K18ac in NCI-H2126 cells. The ERK1/2 pathway downstream factors were detected by RT-PCR and ChIP assays. The regulatory functions of SIRT7, GCN5 and MDM2 in Ras-ERK1/2-regulated H3K18ac expression were finally uncovered. Results: RasG12V/T35S transfection decreased the expression of H3K18ac about 2.5 times compared with the pEGFP-N1 transfection group, and activated ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. Moreover, H3K18ac reduced cell viability, colonies, migration, and altered ERK1/2 downstream transcription in NCI-H2126 cells. Additionally, SIRT7 knockdown increased H3K18ac expression and repressed cell viability, migration and the percentage of cells in S phase by about 50% compared to the control group, as well as changed ERK1/2 downstream factor expression. Besides, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K18ac was linked to MDM2-regulated GCN5 degradation. Conclusion: These observations disclosed that Ras-ERK1/2 promoted the development of lung cancer via decreasing H3K18ac through MDM2-mediated GCN5 degradation. These findings might provide a new therapeutic strategy for lung cancer. "

Oridonin is a natural en-kaurane tetracyclic diterpenoid compound discovered in Rabdosia rubescene (Henmsl.) Hara. Herein, we tested whether oridonin could exert chemo-sensitization activity on cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells. METHODS: Firstly, A2780CP cells and SKOV3/DDP cells were exposed to cisplatin and/or oridonin treatment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) kit and Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V-FITC and PI were carried out to test cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Then, pBeclin-1 was transfected to overexpress Beclin-1. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) acted as autophagy inhibitor, while rapamycin acted as autophagy activator. Finally, the influence of cisplatin and/or oridonin treatment on human normal ovarian epithelial IOSE 364 cell viability and apoptosis were also detected. RESULTS: Oridonin incubation notably elevated the cisplatin-caused reduction of A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell viabilities and enhancement of cell apoptosis. Cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell autophagy was dramatically inhibited by oridonin. Overexpression of Beclin-1 mitigated the influence of oridonin on cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell autophagy. Inhibition of cell autophagy by 3-MA promoted the oridonin + cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell apoptosis, while activation of cell autophagy by rapamycin had opposite effects. Oridonin and cisplatin co-treatment had no significant effects on IOSE 364 cell viability and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The chemo-sensitization activity of oridonin on cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells was verified in this study. Oridonin elevated sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin via suppressing cisplatin-mediated autophagy. "

Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) has been reported to possess beneficial impact on osteoblasts growth. Our study investigated the effects of Tan IIA on fracture healing. METHODS: In vitro, mouse pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with Tan IIA. Then, the protein levels of Runx2, Osx, Collagen I, JNK and c-Jun, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition were detected, respectively. Furthermore, the roles of microRNA-424 (miR-424) and Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation were probed. In vivo, mice open osteotomy at femur diaphysis model was established.

RESULTS: In vitro, Tan IIA promoted MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation via increasing the Runx2, Osx and collagen I expression, along with enhancing ALP activity and calcium deposition. In addition, Tan IIA activated JNK pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells, while inhibition of JNK pathway mitigated the Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation. Moreover, Tan IIA declined the miR-424 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Overexpression of miR-424 also weakened the Tan IIA-caused MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation. BMP-2 was a target gene of miR-424. BMP-2 silence reversed the Tan IIA-caused activation of JNK pathway. In vivo, Tan IIA increased the callus area, callus intensity, BV1/TV, TMD and BMD. CONCLUSION: Tan IIA could promote fracture healing. In vitro, Tan IIA promoted MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation might be via down-regulating miR-424, up-regulating BMP-2 and then activating JNK pathway.

The effects of MIAT on the model were tested by performing CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA. The downstream miRNA and signalling pathways were studied by utilizing qRT-PCR and western blot. Transfection of ATDC5 cells with the shRNA specific against MIAT significantly attenuated LPS-evoked apoptosis and cytokines release. At the meantime, the viability loss and the cleavage of caspases were ameliorated as well. MIAT overexpressed lead to the opposite result. Further, miR-132 was found to be negatively regulated by MIAT. The protective effects of MIAT silence were flattened when miR-132 expression was suppressed.

Essential regulators of mTOR and Notch signalling pathways were examined by Western blot. mRNA expression was accessed using qRT-PCR. Bcl2/adenovirus EIB 19kD-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was altered by transfection. We noticed that NSCs were sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis and showed decreased viability. Moreover, Beclin and light chain 3-II was upregulated while p62 was downregulated. However, AP reversed all these results. Similarly, hypoxia decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K and Notch1 expression while AP increased the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K as well as the expression of Notch1. BNIP3 was upregulated by hypoxia while downregulated by AP. Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of BNIP3 broken all the effects induced by AP shown in cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy and signalling pathways.

Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was negatively regulated by miR-4262, and its overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced cell injury. LPS-induced alterations of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways were reversed by KLF4 overexpression. In conclusion, MEG3 was down-regulated by LPS and its knockdown aggravated LPS-induced injury of human lung cells through miR-4262-mediated down-regulation of KLF4. The PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways were implicated. "

Although LINC00305 regulates biological activities by acting as a miR sponge, it is still unexplored whether LINC00305 is involved in inflammation by regulating miR-124. Methods: Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated with commercial kits, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) kit, respectively. LINC00305, miR-124 and mRNA levels were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein level was assessed with Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The expression of LINC00305 was up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LINC00305 overexpression further suppressed the cell viability, promoted apoptosis and induced inflammation in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells while its silence enhanced the cell viability, inhibited apoptosis and ameliorated inflammation. miR-124 was negatively regulated by LINC00305 and its overexpression abolished the effects of LINC00305 in the presence of LPS. LINC00305 further triggered the Notch/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway in LPS-treated ATDC5 cells and this activation was abrogated when ATDC5 cells overexpressed miR-124. Conclusion: LINC00305 might emerge as a novel suppressor for miR-124.

It is still unclear whether myocardial infarction associated transcript 2 (Mirt2)-miR-377 mediates the inflammatory pathogenesis in Sjoegren's syndrome (SS). Methods: The inflammatory lesion model was established by stimulating salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Mirt2- and/or miR-377-transfected SGECs, as well as their negative controls, were applied to investigate the biological functions in inflammation. Cell viability and apoptosis were examined using commercial kits. Western blot was applied to quantify protein level, and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) was used to value the secretion of cytokines. Results: The up-regulation of Mirt2 was observed in IFN-gamma-treated SGECs. Mirt2 overexpression restored the expression of miR-377 which was repressed by IFN-gamma. However, miR-377 silence abolished the protective effect on cell viability, inhibitory effect on apoptosis and prohibitive role in pro-inflammatory factors. Mirt2 diminished the phosphorylated expression of crucial regulators while miR-377 silence restored the phosphorylation in IFN-gamma-treated SGECs.

We investigated the effect of propofol on JEG-3 cells. The effects of propofol on cell proliferation and metastasis were determined. The expression of miR-495 was suppressed while Twist1 overexpressed. Cell viability, migration and invasion were respectively measured using CCK-8 assay and transwell migration/invasion assay. The expression of miR-495, AKT1 and Twist1 was detected using qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression levels of EMT- and proliferation-related factors, and TGF-beta pathway proteins. Propofol treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and reduced the releasing of EMT. miR-495 was up-regulated by profocol, and miR-495 inhibition reversed the effect of propofol on cell proliferation and metastasis in JEG-3 cells. Furthermore, propofol decreased the expression of AKT1 and Twist1 through up-regulating miR-495, and Twist1 participated in the regulation of propofol on TGF-beta signalling inactivation in JEG-3 cells.

This study attempted to validate UCA1 possessed modulatory function on cell proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1. Ectopic expression of UCA1 was induced in TPC-1 cells by transfection. CCK-8 assays were employed to value cell viability. Cell apoptosis analysis was conducted through flow cytometry. We found that overexpressed UCA1 strongly promoted cell proliferation. However, the knockdown of UCA1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced obvious cell apoptosis. Besides, cell EMT was promoted by overexpressed UCA1 and was inhibited by the knockdown of UCA1. Further study revealed that miR-15a level in TPC-1 cells was suppressed by overexpressed UCA1. Simultaneous overexpression of UCA1 and miR-15a partly alleviated UCA1-induced growth, identifying that miR-15a was a possible target of UCA1.

Human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells were treated by curcumin alone or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) plus curcumin, after which the following parameters were analyzed: cell viability, migration, and the expression of AS-associated factors. The regulatory effects of curcumin on miR-126 and signaling pathways involved in AS were then studied. Further, an animal model of AS was stimulated by feeding rabbits with 1% cholesterol diet.

Increasing evidence confirmed the vital impacts of long noncoding RNAs on various inflammatory diseases. Nonetheless, the influence of taurine-upregulated 1 (TUG1) in pneumonia remains vague. The research tried to disclose the protective impacts of TUG1 against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked injury in MRC-5 cells. METHODS: MRC-5 cells were disposed with LPS to construct pulmonary injury model. Then, pc-TUG1 vector was transfected into MRC-5 cells and the influence of overexpressed TUG1 in cell viability, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-disposed cells were evaluated.

Myricetin protects cardiomyocytes against inflammatory injury. However, it's still unexplored whether myricetin exerted anti-inflammatory properties via MALAT1. The purpose of our study was to validate the cardio-protective function of myricetin against myocarditis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. METHODS: H9c2 cells were pre-incubated with myricetin before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Enforced silence of MALAT1 was achieved by transducing short hairpin (sh)-MALAT1 into H9c2 cells. Next, cell viability and apoptotic cells were detected with cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (Annexin V-FITC/PI) apoptosis detection kit, respectively. Western blot assay was conducted to examine apoptosis-relative proteins, pro-inflammatory factors, and signaling regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to quantify pro-inflammatory factors and MALAT1 at mRNA levels. Enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine protein concentration of pro-inflammatory factors. RESULTS: Myricetin ameliorated LPS-elicited reduction of cell viability, augment of apoptosis, and overexpression of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (IkappaBalpha) were suppressed. Besides, myricetin enhanced the expression of MALAT1 which was originally down-regulated by LPS. However, the protective effects of myricetin against LPS-caused inflammatory lesions were abrogated in MALAT1-deficiency cells, with the restored phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaBalpha. CONCLUSION: Myricetin possessed an anti-inflammatory function against LPS-induced lesions in cardiomyocytes. Mechanically, myricetin up-regulated MALAT1, blocked LPS-evoked activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inflammatory pathway, and, finally, exerted cardio-protective effects. "

After transfection with pc-SNHG16 or miR-423-5p inhibitor, the functions of SNHG16 and miR-423-5p in H2O2-injured cells were studied. AMPK and ERK1/2 pathways were finally assessed by western blot. We found that H2O2 evoked cell injury in PC-12 cells, and repressed SNHG16 was observed in H2O2-disposed cells. Overexpressed SNHG16 prominently alleviated H2O2-induced cell injury as indicated by repressing cell apoptosis, autophagy and ROS level. Additionally, SNGH16 enhanced miR-423-5p expression, and miR-423-5p inhibition abrogated the protective effect of SNGH16 on H2O2-injured PC-12 cells. SNGH16 mediated AMPK and ERK1/2 pathways via up-regulating miR-423-5p in H2O2-injured PC-12 cells. In conclusion, these findings indicated that SNGH16 reduced H2O2-evoked cell injury by mediating miR-423-5p in PC-12 cells. The findings might uncover the effect of SNHG16 on SCI, which provide a new reference for remedying SCI.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in the pathogenesis of OA. Nevertheless, the regulatory impacts of lncRNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (lncRNA-HULC) on OA remain dimness. The study tried to probe the protective effect of HULC on ATDC5 cells against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammatory injury. METHODS: Relative expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) and HULC in OA cartilage tissues and normal cartilage tissues were determined by RT-qPCR. TNF-alpha induced inflammatory injury model in ATDC5 cells was constructed, and the biological functions of HULC overexpression or suppression in TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells were assessed. The relevancy between miR-101 and HULC was investigated by utilizing bioinformatics prediction, luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation. MiR-101 mimic and inhibitor were transfected into ATDC5 cells, and its regulatory effect on TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells was examined. Further, NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways were finally detected by western blot. RESULTS: Enhancement of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 were observated in OA cartilage tissues, but repression of HULC was discovered in OA cartilage tissues. HULC expression was decreased by TNF-alpha treatment, and overexpressed HULC significantly relieved TNF-alpha-induced ATDC5 cells injury. Additionally, miR-101 was mutual repressed with HULC, and overexpressed miR-101 reversed the protective effect of HULC in TNF-alpha-injured ATDC5 cells. Besides, HULC blocked NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways via repression of miR-101. CONCLUSIONS: The discoveries testified that HULC protected ATDC5 cells against TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury by repression of miR-101. "

This study investigated the effect of propofol on breast cancer MCF-7 cells and its possible regulatory mechanisms. MCF-7 cells were treated by propofol, and then the effects of propofol on cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were studied. We subsequently testified whether miR-21 was a downstream effector of propofol. As a result, propofol repressed the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells, but significantly induced apoptosis.

Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, CXCL16, cAMP/PKA/CREB, and PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta pathway-related proteins. RESULTS: OGD significantly inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis. CXCL16 overexpression decreased the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD.

The further study showed that overexpression of miR-424 significantly increased proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD. In addition, we also found that miR-424 was downregulated by PMS2L2. In the subsequence experiment, overexpression of PMS2L2 significantly decreased the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of HMEC-1 induced by OGD, which suggested that PMS2L2 decreased cell damage of HMEC-1 induced by OGD. Simultaneously, CXCL16 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of PKA/CREB and PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta and these signal pathways were blocked by signal inhibitors.

This study aimed to reveal whether KRas mutation drives the initiation and progression of glioma via modulation of H4 acetylation. METHODS: Changes of H4K16 acetylation in human glioblastoma A172 cells following transfection with a plasmid for expression of mutant KRas were tested by western blot analysis. MTT assay, transwell assay, soft-agar colony formation assay, RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation were carried out to evaluate the effect of H4K16ac on A172 cells growth and migration. Furthermore, the enzymes participating in the deacetylation of H4K16ac were studied by using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: H4K16ac was found to be deacetylated by KRas-ERK1/2 activation. H4K16Q (a plasmid for mimicking H4K16ac) repressed A172 cells viability, colony formation, and migratory capacity. Besides, H4K16ac was capable of regulating the transcription of several ERK1/2 pathway downstream genes.

KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrated that LBPs promoted osteoblasts viability, facilitated migration and positively regulated the expression of miR-17. Additionally, miR-17 inhibitor abolished the positive effects of LBPs on the osteoblasts. Molecularly, miR-17 inhibited the expression of PTEN by targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Mechanically, LBPs diminished PTEN expression and facilitated the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, while the decreased expression of PTEN and enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT were reversed by miR-17 inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE: LBPs might fortify osteoblasts viability by up-regulating miR-17 to target PTEN and consequently trigger PI3K/AKT pathway. "

First, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS; to induce AKI rat mesangial cells (RMCs) for establishing the septic AKI model in RMCs. Subsequently, TUG1 was overexpressed in RMCs and the influences of overexpression of TUG1 on cell biological processes (viability, apoptosis, and autophagy) and cytokines secretion in LPS-associated RMCs were investigated. Furthermore, the interaction between TUG1 and miR-142-3p was investigated, and the target of miR-142-3p was predicted. Also, whether TUG1 could regulate the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal was investigated. The results showed that TUG1 was lowly expressed in the serum patients with sepsis-associated AKI compared with that in the controls.

Tripterine has a variety of pharmacological functions, and the therapeutic potential of tripterine in many kinds of inflammation-linked diseases has been revealed. However, the function of tripterine on osteoarthritis still remains unclear. The objective of this study was to study the function of tripterine (TPR) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injured chondrocyte. ATDC5 cells were treated with tripterine after LPS stimulation and then cell survival, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of chondrogenic differentiation-associated proteins were assessed by performing CCK-8, flow cytometry, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot. Moreover, the expression of miR-223 and core factors in PI3K/AKT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling was tested by RT-qPCR/Western blot. LPS stimulation significantly reduced ATDC5 cells viability, induced apoptosis, and increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced chondrocyte loss and the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. miR-223 was down-regulated by LPS, while was up-regulated by tripterine. The protective actions of tripterine were eliminated when miR-223 was silenced. Besides, tripterine inhibited hypertrophic differentiation induced by LPS, and the inhibitory effects of tripterine on hypertrophic differentiation could be abolished when miR-223 was silenced. Furthermore, tripterine activated PI3K/AKT pathway and deactivated NF-kappaB pathway. And the regulatory effects of tripterine on these two pathways were abolished by miR-223 silence. This study revealed that tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced cell damage possibly via up-regulation of miR-223 and modulation of NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT pathways. "

There are few recent studies on emodin in the treatment of myocarditis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of emodin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells were treated with 10 muM of LPS and different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 muM) of emodin. The expression of miR-223 was changed by transient transfection. Thereafter, cell viability, apoptosis, the expression of CyclinD1 and Jnk-associated proteins, and the release of pro-inflammatory factors were assessed by cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively. The results showed that 20 muM of emodin significantly decreased H9c2 cells viability. LPS significantly damaged H9c2 cells, as cell viability was reduced, CyclinD1 was down-regulated, apoptosis was induced, the release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increased, and the phosphorylation of Jnk and c-Jun were promoted. Emodin protected H9c2 cells against LPS-induced inflammatory injury. miR-223 expression was significantly up-regulated by LPS exposure, while emodin lessened this up-regulation. LPS-injured H9c2 cells were attenuated by the overexpression of miR-223; emodin has protective actions on LPS-injured H9c2 cells and targets. Besides, SP600125 (an inhibitor of Jnk) eliminated miR-223-modulated inflammatory injury in H9c2 cells. These data demonstrated that emodin could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory injury and deactivate Jnk signaling pathway through down-regulation of miR-223. "

Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) extracted from Panax ginseng can induce glucose uptake and lower oxidative stress. We aimed to explore the effect of Rg1 on DR using human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19). MAIN METHODS: ARPE-19 cells were grown in high glucose (HG) to simulate DR. Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS generation and miR-26a level were examined by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay, DCFH-DA staining and RT-qPCR, respectively. Expression of proteins associated with viability, apoptosis and oxidative stress was measured by Western blot analysis. Effects of Rg1 on HG-induced alteration were assessed. Moreover, whether miR-26a was involved in Rg1-associated modulation was verified. Finally, the involvements of the ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were analyzed by Western blot analysis. KEY FINDINGS: HG reduced cell viability while promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells. Rg1 ameliorated HG-induced cell injury. The expression of miR-26a was up-regulated by Rg1 in HG-treated cells, and miR-26a inhibition obviously reversed the effects of Rg1 on HG-treated cells.

Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP, also known as ligustrazine) is the main active ingredient isolated from the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. A previous study reported that the TMP could exert cardioprotective activity. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of the protective effects of TMP on cardiomyocyte damage caused by hypoxia. The viability and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes H9c2 were detected using cell counting kit-8 assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to measure the expression level of microRNA-449a (miR-449a). Cell transfection was performed to upregulate the expression level of miR-449a or downregulate the expression level of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). The protein expression levels of Sirt1 and key factors involved in cell apoptosis and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase 3 (PI3K/AKT) pathway were evaluated using western blot analysis. We found that the hypoxia incubation inhibited H9c2 viability, induced cell apoptosis, and inactivated the PI3K/AKT pathway. TMP treatment partially relieved the hypoxia-caused H9c2 cell viability loss and apoptosis, as well as reversed the hypoxia-caused inactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, TMP partially alleviated the upregulation of miR-449a in H9c2 cells caused by hypoxia. Overexpression of miR-449a weakened the effects of TMP on hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells. Furthermore, Sirt1 was a target gene of miR-449a. Knockdown of Sirt1 also weakened the effects of TMP on hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells. In conclusion, TMP partially relieved hypoxia-caused cardiomyocytes H9c2 viability loss and apoptosis at least through downregulating miR-499a, upregulating Sirt1, and then activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.

The current conventional treatments are unsatisfactory. Histone acetylation at H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, whether H3K56ac prevents the occurrence and development of UM remains uninvestigated. The study aimed to explore the regulatory effect of H3K56ac on Ras-PI3K-AKT induced UM cells proliferation and migration. METHODS: The vectors of pEGFP-RasWT , pEGFP-K-Ras G12V/Y40C , and pEGFP-N1 were transfected into MP46 cells, and protein levels of phosphorylated AKT Ser473 and H3K56ac were examined using western blot analysis. The effect of H3K56ac on cell proliferation and migration were studied using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) downstream genes. Further, the regulatory effects of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1), general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), and mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) on Ras-PI3K-AKT affected H3K56ac expression were also investigated. RESULTS: H3K56ac expression was specifically downregulated by Ras-PI3K-AKT activation pathway. H3K56ac inhibited the tumorigenic effect of Ras-PI3K-AKT on MP46 cells viability, colony formation, and migration, as well as participated in regulating the transcription of PI3K/AKT downstream genes. SIRT1 silence recovered H3K56ac expression, and reversed the tumorigenic effect of Ras-PI3K-AKT activation on MP46 cells. Downregulation of H3K56ac induced by Ras-PI3K-AKT activation was found to be associated with MDM2-mediated the degradation of GCN5. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that Ras-PI3K-AKT signaling promoted UM cells proliferation and migration via downregulation of H3K56ac expression, which might be related to MDM2-mediated the degradation of GCN5.

Histone acetylation at H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ac) is closely associated with gene expression and DNA damage. However, whether H3K14ac participates in mediating Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell proliferation and migration in uveal melanoma cells remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of H3K14ac on Ras-ERK1/2 affected uveal melanoma cell phenotypes. MP65 cells were transfected with Ras WT and Ras G12V/T35S , the unloaded plasmid of pEGFP-N1 served as a negative control. Protein levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 Thr202 and H3K14ac were assessed by western blot assay. Cell viability, number of colonies, migration, and the downstream genes of ERK1/2 were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, soft-agar colony formation, transwell, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. HA-tag vectors of CLR3 and TIP60 and the small interfering RNAs that specific for CLR3 and MDM2 were transfected into MP65 cells to uncover the effects of CLR3, TIP60, and MDM2 on Ras-ERK1/2 mediated H3K14ac expression and MP65 cell phenotypes. We found that, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac expression in MP65 cells, and H3K14ac significantly suppressed Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell viability, colony formation, and migration in MP65 cells. Moreover, the transcription of CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15, and CARD16 was regulated by H3K14ac. Additionally, CLR3 silence recovered H3K14ac expression and reversed the effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MP65 cell proliferation, migration and the mRNAs of ERK1/2 downstream genes. Besides, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac expression by MDM2-mediated TIP60 degradation. In conclusion, Ras-ERK1/2 promoted uveal melanoma cells growth and migration by downregulating H3K14ac via MDM2-mediated TIP60 degradation. "

Herein, we aimed to examine the efficacy of TPL in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and to reveal its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Human CRC cell lines HT-29 and SW480 were treated by TPL for 24 h in the presence or absence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer TGF-beta1. The expression of miR-191 in cell was overexpressed by miRNA transfection. Thereafter, cell viability, migration, apoptosis, EMT-related protein expressions, and the activation of NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were respectively assessed. Moreover, a mouse model of CRC was established and the effects of TPL on the growth of primary tumors were tested. RESULTS: TPL (50 and 100 nM) significantly reduced cell viability and migration, but increased apoptotic cell rate. TPL up-regulated Bax, increased the cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, and neutralized TGF-beta1-induced alterations of EMT indicators, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. At the meantime, TPL treatment down-regulated miR-191 expression, and the effect of TPL on miR-191 expression was mediated by EZH2. More interestingly, anti-CRC properties and the inhibitory effects of TPL on NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways were reversed by miR-191 up-regulation. In vivo data showed that, TPL treatment decreased the growth of primary tumor xenografts and the expression of miR-191. CONCLUSION: TPL is effective in killing CRC cells and suppressing the migratory capacity. TPL exerts anti-CRC properties possibly via down-regulating miR-191, and blocking the activation of NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. "

METHODS: Hypoxic injury model was constructed to mimic MI. Effects of GSTD pretreatment on cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay, Western blot analysis, and flow cytometry/Western blot analysis, respectively. Expression of miR-21 in cells treated with hypoxia or hypoxia plus GSTD was determined by stem-loop RT-PCR. Whether GSTD affected hypoxia-injured cells via miR-21 was subsequently verified. The direct target of miR-21 was studied by bio-informatics ways and luciferase reporter assay. Besides, expression levels of key kinases in the PTEN/PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways were testified by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced decrease of cell viability, up-regulation of p53 and p16, increase of apoptotic cells and up-regulation of Bax, cleaved casapse-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were all mitigated by GSTD pretreatment. Expression of miR-21 was up-regulated by hypoxia and was further up-regulated by GSTD treatment. In transfected H9c2 cells, effects of GSTD on hypoxia-treated cells were augmented by miR-21 overexpression while were reversed by miR-21 inhibition. PDCD4 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-21, and reversed the effect of miR-21 on hypoxia-injured cells. Finally, GSTD down-regulated PTEN expression and enhanced phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, p65 and IkappaBalpha via up-regulating miR-21. CONCLUSION: GSTD attenuated hypoxic injury of H9c2 cells through activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways via up-regulating miR-21. "

This study attempted to show the potential role of lncRNA CHRF in bacterial infection caused myocarditis. METHODS: H9c2 cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for lncRNA CHRF alone or in combination with miR-221 inhibitor, and then subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The following parameters were measured: cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, pro-inflammatory cytokines release, microRNA (miR)-221 expression and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. RESULTS: Silence of lncRNA CHRF impeded the LPS injury to H9c2 cells, as cell viability was increased (p < .05), apoptosis was inhibited (p < .05), ROS generation was decreased (p < .01), and the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was suppressed (p < .05). However, silence of lncRNA CHRF had no impacts on normal H9c2 cells growth (p > .05). miR-221 was negatively regulated by lncRNA CHRF (p < .01). LncRNA CHRF silence did not protect H9c2 cells against LPS when miR-221 was suppressed (p < .05 or p < .01). Also, the inhibitory effects of lncRNA CHRF silence on the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways were flattened by miR-221 suppression (p < .05 or p < .01). CONCLUSION: These in vitro data collectively demonstrated that lncRNA CHRF silence protected H9c2 cells against LPS-induced injury via up-regulating miR-221 and modulating NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.

Emodin possesses biological properties in protecting against some diseases. Our study investigated to explore the effects of emodin on hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes, which mimicked CHD in vitro. METHODS: H9c2 cells were stimulated with hypoxia and then the cells were treated with or without emodin, and/or transfected with miR-26a mimic, pcDNA-survivin and their corresponding negative control (NC). Cell viability and cell apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In addition, the expression of apoptotic proteins, Janus kinase 1 (JNK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway factors, and survivin were evaluated by using Western blot analysis. The expression of miR-26a was analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the target of miR-26a was verified by using a luciferase report assay. RESULTS: Hypoxia significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis, and the accumulated levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 were upregulated by hypoxia compared with the control. However, emodin administration led to the opposite result. A further result showed that emodin increased the phosphorylation of JNK/STAT3 pathway-related proteins and the pathway inhibitor AG490 impaired the protective effects of emodin on hypoxia-induced injury. In addition, emodin negatively regulated the miR-26a expression, and overexpression of miR-26a enhanced cell apoptosis and upregulated the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 compared with the NC. Moreover, emodin statistically upregulated the expression of survivin, and overexpression of miR-26a decreased the expression of survivin. The luciferase of miR-26a overexpression was decreased in the wild type of the survivin group. CONCLUSION: Emodin protects hypoxia-induced cell injury as evidenced by increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis through downregulation of miR-26a as well as activation of the JNK/STAT3 pathway.

The expression of CyclinD1, apoptosis related proteins (p53, Bcl-2, Bax, pro-/Cleaved-Caspase-3), migration and invasion related proteins (MMP-9 and vimentin), and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) related proteins (p/t-PI3K, p/t-AKT) were examined by western blot. The expression of CCAT1 was measured by quantitative real time RCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Rg3 significantly decreased cell viability, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Meanwhile, the expression of Cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and vimentin was downregulated. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins p53, Bax, and Cleaved-Caspase-3 were upregulated while Bcl-2 was downregulated by the treatment of Rg3 compared with control. Furthermore, CCAT1 was upregulated in CRC tissue and Rg3 negatively regulated CCAT1 expression. Transfection with pc-CCAT1 led to the opposite results as compared with transfection with pcDNA3.1 in Rg3 treated cells. In addition, Rg3 decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits migration and invasion, and promotes apoptosis of Caco-2 cells by suppression expression of LncRNA CCAT1. "

Different concentrations of cisplatin (0-320 microM) were used to stimulate A549 and A549/DDP cells, and cell viability and apoptosis were examined. To investigate the effect of Lido on A549/DDP cells, the optimum concentration of Lido was selected to treat A549/DDP cells, and cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were then detected. The relative expression of miR-21 in A549/DDP cells or in Lido-treated A549/DDP cells was analyzed by RT-qPCR. MiR-21 mimic, inhibitor and its control were transfected into A549/DDP cells to explore the regulatory effect of miR-21 on the cisplatin resistance in A549 or A549/DDP cells. The effects of miR-21 on PTEN/PI3K/AKT and PDCD4/JNK pathways were detected by western blot. The cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells was higher than that of A549 cells.

Current remains lack of effective method for glaucoma. Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) have pleiotropic effects on various diseases. However, the effect of LBPs on glaucoma remains unclear. The study aimed to clarify the protective effect of LBPs against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. HTM cells were exposed to H2O2 (0-400 muM) for 24 h to construct an oxidative damage model. Then, the different concentrations of LBPs (0-500 mug mL-1) were used to pre-treated HTM cells, and cell viability, apoptosis, protein levels of pro-/cleaved-caspase-3 and pro-/cleaved-caspase-9, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generations were detected. MicroRNA (miR)-4295 inhibitor and its control were transfected into HTM cells, and the biological functions of miR-4295 were assessed in H2O2 and LBPs treated cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein Kinase B (AKT) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathways were determined by western blot assay. LBPs significantly promoted cell viability, reduced apoptosis, declined cleaved-caspase-3/-9 and ROS level in HTM cells after H2O2 administration. MiR-4295 expression was up-regulated in H2O2 and LBPs treated cells. The protective effect of LBPs on H2O2-injured HTM cells was obviously reversed by miR-4295 inhibition. LBPs activated PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways through up-regulation of miR-4295 in H2O2-injured HTM cells. These data demonstrated that LBPs alleviated H2O2-induced injury by up-regulation of miR-4295 in HTM cells, indicating the protective effect of LBPs on HTM cells against oxidative damage. "

BCAR4 up-regulation promotes proliferation and suppresses apoptosis of NTHY-ORI 3-1 cells and human primary thyrocytes, and EGFR is highly expressed in BCAR4 over-expressing-cells. In contrast, BCAR4 up-regulation did not modulate cell viability or cell cycle progression when EGFR was knocked-down.

However, the molecular regulation following by Ras-ERK1/2 activation is still unclear. This work aimed to reveal whether Ras-ERK1/2 promoted the development of colorectal cancer via regulating H3K9ac. METHODS: A vector for expression of K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S was transfected into SW48 cells, and the acetylation of H3K9 was measured by Western blot analysis. MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RT-qPCR were performed to detect whether H3K9ac was contributed to K-Ras-mediated cell growth and migration. Furthermore, whether HDAC2 and PCAF involved in modification of H3K9ac following Ras-ERK1/2 activation were studied. RESULTS: K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S induced a significant activation of ERK1/2 signaling and a significant down-regulation of H3K9ac. Recovering H3K9 acetylation by using a mimicked H3K9ac expression vector attenuated the promoting effects of Ras-ERK1/2 on tumor cells growth and migration.

RESULTS: The model of OGD induced RGC-5 cells injury was successfully constructed in vitro. AST significantly alleviated OGD-induced RGC-5 cells injury by increasing cell viability, inhibiting apoptosis and regulating cell cycle-associated factors (p16, p53, and Cyclin D1) as well as apoptosis-associated factors (Bax, cleaced-Caspase-3/-9).

In this study, Neferin (Nef) was hoped to control growth and migration of GIST cell line GIST-T1. METHODS: Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method, and Transwell assay, respectively. The expression level of miR-449a was determined by qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was conducted to alter the expression level of miR-449a. Protein expression levels of key factors involved in cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell migration, PI3K/AKT pathway and Notch pathways were analyzed by western boltting. RESULTS: Nef significantly inhibited GIST-T1 cell viability, proliferation, migration, but promoted cell apoptosis. The expression level of miR-449a was up-regulated in GIST-T1 cells after Nef treatment.

This study aimed to elucidate the roles and possible mechanism of long noncoding RNA Component Of Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease (RMRP) in protecting against ischemic myocardial injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured under hypoxia condition to induce myocardial injury. The RMRP expression under hypoxia condition was determined, followed by investigation of the effects of RMRP dysregulation on hypoxia-induced injury in H9c2 cells. In addition, the regulatory relationship between RMRP and miR-206 was detected, and the potential target of miR-206 was identified. Besides, the association of RMRP and activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was explored. Furthermore, an in vivo rat model of myocardial I/R injury was established by subjection to 60 min ischemia and subsequently 24 h reperfusion for validation of the role of RMRP in regulating myocardial I/R injury in vivo. RESULTS: The results showed that overexpression of RMRP aggravated hypoxia-induced injury in H9c2 cells. Moreover, miR-206 was negatively regulated by RMRP and overexpression of RMRP aggravated hypoxia injury by downregulation of miR-206. Furthermore, ATG3 was a target of miR-206, and he effects of miR-206 on hypoxia injury were through targeting ATG3. Besides, overexpression of RMRP activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in hypoxia-treated H9c2 cells, which were reversed by miR-206 overexpression at the same time. Furthermore, in an in vivo rat model of myocardial I/R injury, suppression of RMPR improved cardiac function and inhibited apoptosis after myocardial I/R injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that upregulation of RMRP may aggravate myocardial I/R injury possible by downregulation of miR-206 and subsequently upregulation of ATG3. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be a key downstream mechanism mediating the cardioprotection of RMPR/miR-206/ATG3 axis against myocardial I/R injury. "

Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is one main active ingredient of Radix notoginseng. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional effects of NGR1 on atherosclerosis (AS). METHODS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), before which cells were preconditioned with NGR1. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were carried out to assess the impacts of ox-LDL and NGR1 on HUVECs. Besides, the expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132), and the regulatory role of miR-132 in Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) expression were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: NGR1 pre-conditioning prevented ox-LDL-induced apoptosis, migration and overproduction of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP-1) and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). miR-132 was up-regulated in response to ox-LDL while was down-regulated by NGR1 pre-conditioning. The protective actions of NGR1 in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs were enhanced by miR-132 inhibitor, while were attenuated by miR-132 mimic. Besides, the up-regulated miR-132 could further decrease the expression of MGP, which acted as an anti-migratory and anti-adhesive factor. Furthermore, ox-LDL-induced the activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were partially attenuated by NGR1, and were fully eliminated by NGR1 treatment together with MGP overexpression.

GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected by CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays. Western blot investigated expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins, and association was established between over-expressed HOST2 and the number of patients with lymph node and distant metastasis. HOST2 expression was also positively related to GC cell invasion ability, and although its expression in the p-shHOST2 group was remarkably decreased, it was significantly higher than in the Mock and NC groups. Compared to the Mock and NC groups, the p-shHOST2 group presented significant decreases in proliferation and wound healing rates, and the reverse result was noted in the p-HOST2 group. In addition, the number of p-shHOST2 group invasive cells was remarkably less than in the Mock and NC group, and the opposite result was achieved in the p-HOST2 group. Moreover, p-HOST2 had more significant EMT, but this was suppressed in the p-shHOST2 group. Finally, HOST2 silencing suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion; and it could therefore be considered as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer. "

While Skullcapflavone I has been reported to exert anti-tumor effect in several cancers, its role in CRC has not previously been investigated. Recent studies have also demonstrated that microRNA-107 (miR-107) and tropomyosin alpha-1 (TPM1) are important regulators of cancer cell proliferation, but it remains unclear if these are involved in regulating the effect of Skullcapflavone I on CRC cells. This study therefore assessed the effects of Skullcapflavone I on CRC cell proliferation and investigated miR-107 and TPM1 regulatory effects on this process. The results showed that Skullcapflavone I significantly suppressed cell proliferation and viability and down-regulated PCNA and Cyclin D1protein levels. It also down-regulated miR-107 expression which then promoted TPM1 expression, but miR-107 over-expression abolished Skullcapflavone I anti-proliferative effects. Furthermore, Skullcapflavone I inhibited the activations of MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB signal pathway activation by regulating TPM1 in HCT116 cells. These results demonstrated that Skullcapflavone I increased the expression of TPM1 by down-regulating miR-107 and inhibiting the MEK/ERK and NF-kappaB signal pathways. It then inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation, and therefore Skullcapflavone I may provide new methodology in colorectal cancer treatment. "

Recent studies have proven that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to tumor growth and metastasis. The study aimed to explore the effect of LINC00978 on GC cells proliferation and tumorigenesis. LINC00978 was up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of LINC00978 was positively correlated with low survival rate. LINC00978 silence inhibited proliferation, metastasis, and promoted apoptosis in BGC-823 cells.

Triptolide (TPL) has been reported to be a potential anticancer agent. However, the potential effects of TPL on BPH have not been shown out. BPH-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of TPL and/or transfected with microRNA-218 (miR-218) inhibitor, pc-survivin, sh-survivin, or their corresponding controls (NC). Thereafter, cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was accessed by modified two-chamber migration assay. Cell apoptosis was checked by propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Annexin V staining. In addition, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. BPH-1 cell viability and migration were significantly decreased, while cell apoptosis and expression of miR-218 were statistically enhanced by TPL ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, downregulation of miR-218 increased cell viability and migration, while decreased cell apoptosis compared with the negative control group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Furthermore, the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and cell apoptosis-related proteins were also led to the opposite results with NC. In addition, we found that miR-218 negatively regulated the expression of survivin ( P < 0.01) and suppression of survivin significantly enhanced cell apoptosis ( P < 0.01). Moreover, the results demonstrated that TPL could inactivate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while inhibition of miR-218 alleviated the effects. TPL inhibits viability and migration of BPH-1 cells and induces cell apoptosis and also inactivates mTOR signal pathway via upregulation of miR-218. This study provides evidence for the further studies representing triptolide as a potential agent in the treatment of human BPH. "

Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a tumor suppressor in diverse cancer types. However, the role of MEG3 in glioma remains unclear. We aimed to explore the effects of MEG3 on U251 cells as well as the underlying mechanisms. U251 cells were stably transfected with different recombined plasmids to overexpress or silence MEG3. Effects of aberrantly expressed MEG3 on cell viability, migration, apoptosis, expressions of apoptosis-associated and autophagy-associated proteins, and phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were all evaluated. Then, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Sirt7 in cells abnormally expressing MEG3 were estimated.

This study aimed to reveal the effects of AS-IV on hypoxia-injured cardiomyocyte. METHODS: H9c2 cells were treated with various doses of AS-IV for 24 h upon hypoxia. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry/Western blot, and qRT-PCR were respectively conducted to measure the changes in cell viability, apoptosis, and the expression of miR-23a and miR-92a. Sprague-Dawley rats were received coronary ligation, and were administrated by various doses of AS-IV for 14 days. The infarct volume and outcome of rats followed by ligation were tested by ultrasound, arteriopuncture and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) staining. RESULTS: We found that 10 mug/ml of AS-IV exerted myocardioprotective effects against hypoxia-induced cell damage, as AS-IV significantly increased H9c2 cells viability and decreased apoptosis. Interestingly, the myocardioprotective effects of AS-IV were alleviated by miR-23a and/or miR-92a overexpression. Knockdown of miR-23a and miR-92a activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ ERK signaling pathways. Bcl-2 was a target gene for miR-23a, and BCL2L2 was a target gene for miR-92a. In the animal model of myocardial infarction (MI), AS-IV significantly reduced the infarct volume, ejection fraction (EF), shortening fraction (FS) and LV systolic pressure (LVSP), and significantly increased left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter (LVEDd). And also, the elevated expression of miR-23a and miR-92a in MI rat was reduced by AS-IV. CONCLUSION: AS-IV protected cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced injury possibly via down-regulation of miR-23a and miR-92a, and via activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. "

Although the anti-tumor role of baicalein (BAI) in bladder cancer has been reported, the details of regulatory mechanism and the interaction between BAI and microRNAs (miRs) remain unclear. We aimed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of BAI in bladder cancer. METHODS: T24 cell viability after BAI treatments was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Then, effects of BAI on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and expressions of proteins involved were assessed by BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry assay, Transwell cell migration assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. We subsequently testified the miR-106 and p21 level using stem-loop RT-PCR. In addition, whether BAI affected T24 cells through regulating miR-106 was verified. Double luciferase reporter assay was used to determine a target of miR-106. The involvements of the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways were finally measured. RESULTS: First of all, we verified that BAI could repress proliferation and migration, and promote apoptosis. Then, we interestingly identified that miR-106 level was decreased by BAI stimulation. After that, miR-106 overexpression was found to significantly reverse the effects of BAI on proliferation, migration and apoptosis of T24 cells. p21 was a target of miR-106. Finally, phosphorylated levels of JNK, MEK and ERK were reduced by BAI, and those reductions were reversed by miR-106 overexpression. Furthermore, phosphorylated levels of JNK, MEK and ERK were reduced by p21 upregulation.

Overexpression of MALAT1 significantly reversed the LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury, while suppression of MALAT1 had opposite effects. Further results showed that MALAT1 positively regulated the expression of miR-19b in ATDC5 cells. Knockdown of miR-19b reversed the protective effect of MALAT1 on LPS-induced ATDC5 cells.

Luteolin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in plants with anti-inflammatory effect. This study aimed to explore the effects of luteolin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bronchopneumonia injury in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, the viability and apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells after luteolin treatment were assessed. Then, cells were treated with 10 muM LPS to simulate inflammatory injury. The potential protective effects of luteolin on LPS-induced BEAS-2B cell inflammatory injury were detected. Moreover, after LPS and/or luteolin treatment, the expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132) in BEAS-2B cells was measured. The roles of miR-132 in protective activity of luteolin were investigated. Finally, the LPS-induced bronchopneumonia murine model was established and the anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin in vivo were analyzed. The results showed that LPS decreased BEAS-2B cell viability, increased cell apoptosis and enhanced inflammatory cytokines expression. Luteolin alleviated the LPS-induced viability loss, apoptosis and elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, luteolin alleviated the LPS-induced miR-132 expression increase in BEAS-2B cells. Overexpression of miR-132 reversed the protective effects of luteolin on LPS-induced inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, luteolin mitigated LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway by down-regulation of miR-132. Furthermore, we also found that luteolin alleviated LPS-induced bronchopneumonia model in vivo. In conclusion, this study revealed that luteolin alleviated LPS-induced bronchopneumonia injury in vitro and in vivo through down-regulating miR-132. These findings provide theoretical basis for deeply exploring the treatment of bronchopneumonia in children by using luteolin. "

Among which, miR-208a and miR-499 are reported to function as ischemic injury promoting miRNAs. This study aimed to explore the in vitro function of miR-208b in MI, which has not been widely studied. METHODS: RT-qPCR was conducted to measure the expression changes of miR-208b in MI patients, MI mouse model and H9c2 cells stimulated by hypoxia. H9c2 cells were subjected to hypoxia before which miR-208b expression was altered by transfection. CCK-8, flow cytometry and Western blot were performed to detect cell survival. Besides, the regulatory relationship between miR-208b, Bax, and PI3K/AKT was tested by luciferase reporter, RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Serum levels of miR-208b in MI patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls. Also, miR-208b was up-regulated in mouse model and cell model of MI. Overexpression of miR-208b protected H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced apoptosis, as the viability was increased, apoptosis rate was decreased, Bax and Cytochrome c were down-regulated, and Bcl-2 was up-regulated. Bax was a target gene of miR-208b. And miR-208b could not protect H9c2 cells when Bax was overexpressed. More interestingly, miR-208b activated PI3K/AKT pathway via targeting Bax, and the activated PI3K/AKT pathway could further repress Bax expression. Finally, blocking PI3K/AKT pathway by using LY294002 eliminated the myocardioprotective effects of miR-208b. CONCLUSION: miR-208b is highly expressed during MI, and miR-208b protects H9c2 cells against hypoxia-induced apoptosis. miR-208b exerts myocardioprotective effect via targeting Bax and activating PI3K/AKT pathway.

Hence, in this study, we constructed H9c2 cell model to elucidate the roles of microRNA-486 (miR-486) in preventing hypoxia-induced damage in H9c2 cells. METHODS: H9c2 cells were cultured in hypoxic incubator with 1% O2 to simulate hypoxia and/or transfected with miR-486 mimic, scramble, anti-miR-486, si-N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) and their corresponding negative controls (NC). Effects of miR-486 and/or NDRG2 dysregulation on hypoxia-induced myocardial injury in H9c2 cells were investigated by evaluating cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell assay, flow cytometry, respectively.

The specific aim of this study is to decode one of the mechanisms by which RSV protects chondrocyte. METHODS: Mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 was treated with 30 microM RSV for 24 h, and 10 microg/ml LPS for 12 h, after which cell viability, apoptosis, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed. The expression of miR-146b in ATDC5 cells was silenced by the specific inhibitor transfection, and then cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation were re-assessed. RESULTS: The IC50 value of LPS in ATDC5 cells was about 10.27 microg/ml. LPS with a dosage of 10 microg/ml repressed cell viability, induced apoptosis, and increased the release of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. RSV pre-treatment (30 microM) significantly alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation. More importantly, miR-146b was up-regulated by RSV, and the protective functions of RSV on ATDC5 cells were attenuated by miR-146b silence. Further, NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways were activated by LPS, and were deactivated by RSV. Besides, RSV-induced the deactivation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways was reversed by miR-146b silence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RSV protects ATDC5 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory and apoptotic injury via up-regulation of miR-146b and thereby deactivation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK pathways.

","Thyroid cancer is a common malignant tumor. Long non-coding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (lncRNA CCAT1) is highly expressed in many cancers; however, the molecular mechanism of CCAT1 in thyroid cancer remains unclear. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of CCAT1 on human thyroid cancer cell line FTC-133. FTC-133 cells were transfected with CCAT1 expressing vector, CCAT1 shRNA, miR-143 mimic, and miR-143 inhibitor, respectively. After different treatments, cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were measured. Moreover, the regulatory relationship of CCAT1 and miR-143, as well as miR-143 and VEGF were tested using dual-luciferase reporter assay. The relative expressions of CCAT1, miR-143, and VEGF were tested by qRT-PCR. The expressions of apoptosis-related factors and corresponding proteins in PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways were analyzed using western blot analysis. The results suggested that CCAT1 was up-regulated in the FTC-133 cells. CCAT1 suppression decreased FTC-133 cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and miR-143 expression, while it increased apoptosis and VEGF expression. CCAT1 might act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-143. Moreover, CCAT1 activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways through inhibition of miR-143. This study demonstrated that CCAT1 exhibited pro-proliferative and pro-metastasis functions on FTC-133 cells and activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways via down-regulation of miR-143. These findings will provide a possible target for clinical treatment of thyroid cancer. "

However, the role and molecular mechanism of miR-3129 in GC is largely unknown. We aimed to explore the function and the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-3129 in GC. Cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues were collected from 50 patients with GC, and the expression of miR-3129 was detected by RT-qPCR. The expression of miR-3129 and pRb in human GC cell line SCG7091 was altered by transient transfection. Thereafter, MTT and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze cell viability and cell cycle. The expression of cyclin E, CDK2, CDK2 inhibitors (p16 and 21), and pRb were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. A significant up-regulation of miR-3129 was observed in GC tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Overexpression of miR-3129 significantly improved cell viability after 4 days of post-transfection. Flow cytometry assay results showed that the miR-3129 overexpression arrested more SGC7901 cells at S phase. Moreover, overexpression of miR-3129 down-regulated the expression of CDK2 inhibitors while it up-regulated the expression levels of cyclin E, CDK2, and pRb. Interestingly, we found that pRb inhibition reversed the effect of miR-3129 inhibitor on cell proliferation in SGC7901 cells, increased cell viability, reduced cells at G0/1 phase, and modulated the expression of proliferation-related factors. Our results revealed that miR-3129 functioned as an oncogene through positive regulation of pRb and may prove to be a promising option for molecular therapy of GC. "

The mechanisms of lncRNAs in various diseases have attracted much attention of researchers. Herein, we investigated the effects and regulations of lncRNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) on UVB-induced injury in HaCaT cells. The HaCaT cells were exposed to UVB at a wavelength of 280-320 nm. Cell viability was detected at different times (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h) after UVB treatment. Cells were transfected with sh-HULC, pc-HULC, sh-BNIP3 (Bcl-2 interacting protein 3) or pc-BNIP3, respectively. ZM 39,923 HCl was used as JAK/STAT(1/3) inhibitor.

The expression changes of HULC and BNIP3 were measured by qRT-PCR. We found that UVB decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis and autophagy, and up-regulated the expression of HULC in HaCaT cells. Overexpression of HULC reduced cell viability, enhanced apoptosis and autophagy, and up-regulated BNIP3 expression by activating JAK/STAT(1/3) signaling pathway. Finally, BNIP3 suppression increased cell viability, reduced apoptosis and autophagy via the deactivation of mTOR signaling pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The miR-1247 expression in acute stage patients with infantile pneumonia was detected. To establish the cell model of acute pneumonia, A549 cells were treated with 1 mg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The effects of miR-1247 dysregulation on the cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation and autophagy of LPS-induced A549 cells were investigated. Moreover, the functional targets of miR-1247 were identified and the regulatory relationships between miR-1247 and JNK or NF-kappaB pathways were explored. RESULTS: The miR-1247 was lowly expressed in acute phage patients with infantile pneumonia. In addition, LPS treatment significantly inhibited A549cell viability, induced apoptosis, promoted the production of cytokines and decreased autophagy, thus causing A549 cell injury. Moreover, miR-1247 was decreased expression after LPS treatment, and overexpression of miR-1247 alleviated LPS-induced A549 cell injury. Furthermore, CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 16 was a functional target gene of miR-1247. Knockdown of CCL16 alleviated LPS-induced cell injury, and the combination of miR-1247 inhibition and CCL16 knockdown reversed the effects of CCL16 knockdown alone on LPS-induced A549 cell injury. Besides, inhibition of miR-1247 activated JNK and NF-kappaB pathways, while knockdown of CCL16 inhibited the activation of these pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveals that miR-1247 is lowly expressed in acute stage patients with infantile pneumonia. Overexpression of miR-1247 may alleviate LPS-induced A549 cell injury through targeting CCL16. JNK and NF-kappaB pathways may be key mechanisms to regulate the role of miR-1247 in LPS-induced lung injury. "

Irradiation is one of the available options for treatment of PCa, however, approximately 10-45% of PCa are resistant to irradiation. We aimed to explore the role of long non-coding RNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) in the sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation. Survival rate, cell apoptosis, cycle, expressions of related proteins, and caspase-3 activity were assessed to explore the effects of HULC on sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation. Expression of HULC in DU-145, PC3, LNCaP, and RWPE-1 cells was determined and the influence of HULC on DU-145 cells was explored. Then, PC3 cells aberrantly expressing HULC were implanted into NOD-SCID mice for tumor xenograft study. Changes of autophagy after aberrant expression of HULC in vivo and in vitro were tested. Furthermore, the interacted protein of HULC and involved signaling pathway were investigated. In PC3 and LNCaP cells under irradiation, survival rate and cell cycle were decreased and apoptosis was increased by HULC knockdown. HULC knockdown arrested PC3 cells at G0/G1 phase. DU-145 was sensitive to irradiation, and resistance to irradiation of DU-145 cells was enhanced by HULC overexpression. Moreover, HULC knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of PC3 xenografts to irradiation. HULC knockdown promoted autophagy through interaction with Beclin-1 and inhibition of mTOR, resulting in increased apoptosis. HULC knockdown improved sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation both in vivo and in vitro. HULC suppressed Beclin-1 phosphorylation, thereby reduced autophagy, involving the mTOR pathway. "

H9c2 cells and human cardiomyocytes (HCM) were subjected to either hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), I/R or normal conditions (normoxia). The expression levels of lncRNA-ROR were detected in serum of myocardial I/R injury patients, H9c2 cells, and HCM by qRT-PCR. Then, levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were measured by kits. Cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors, and p38/MAPK pathway were examined by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined by H2DCF-DA and MitoSOX Red probes with flow cytometry. NADPH oxidase activity and NOX2 protein levels were measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence and western blot. Results showed that lncRNA-ROR expression was increased in I/R patients and in H/R treatment of H9c2 cells and HCM. Moreover, lncRNA-ROR significantly promoted H/R-induced myocardial injury via stimulating release of LDH, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX. Furthermore, lncRNA-ROR decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and regulated expression of apoptosis-associated factors. Additionally, lncRNA-ROR increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 expression and inhibition of p38/MAPK, and rescued lncRNA-ROR-induced cell injury in H9c2 cells and HCM. ROS production, NADPH oxidase activity, and NOX2 protein levels were promoted by lncRNA-ROR.

Trypan blue staining, BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry detection, ELISA, and western blot assay were performed to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. We found that miR-27a was lowly expressed in response to TNF-alpha exposure in hMVICs.

NELL-1 was positively regulated by miR-27a, and NELL-1 up-regulation exhibited protective functions during TNF-alpha-induced cell damage. Furthermore, miR-27a blocked JNK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways, and the blockage was abolished when NELL-1 was silenced. This study demonstrated that miR-27a overexpression protected hMVICs from TNF-alpha-induced cell damage, which might be via up-regulation of NELL-1 and thus modulation of JNK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.

The expression of miR-9 in cell was overexpressed or suppressed by miRNA transfection. Thereafter, cell viability, apoptosis and autophagy were assessed, respectively. RESULTS: High glucose exhibited cytotoxicity in PC-12 cells. Emodin protected PC-12 cells against high glucose-induced apoptosis and viability impairment. These observations were coupled with the down-regulations of p21, p16, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and -9, and the up-regulations of CyclinD1 and Bcl-2.

Here, we aimed to explore the functional impacts of GATA4 acetylation on osteoporosis (OS). METHODS: GATA4 acetylation in hFOB1.19 and 293T cells was detected after exposure of HDAC inhibitors (TSA and SAHA). Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted to determine which HATs and HDACs was involved in the modulation of GATA4 acetylation/deacetylation, and to identify the acetylation site. The transcriptional activity of GATA4 was measured in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Furthermore, hFOB1.19 cells viability and apoptosis were evaluated after transfection with acetylation-defective mutant of GATA4. RESULTS: As a result, GATA4 acetylation was identified as a pivotal event in hFOB1.19 cells. GATA4 can be acetylated by P300/CBP, and the acetylation site was on lysine residue K313. Besides, the acetylation of GATA4 can be impaired by HDAC1, rather than by HDAC2-5. GATA4 acetylation contributed to the stability and transcription of GATA4. Moreover, GATA4 acetylation activated CCND2 transcription, and mutation of GATA4 on K-313 reduced cell viability and increased a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in hFOB1.19 cells.

This study aimed to explore the effects of long noncoding RNA CAT104 and microRNA-381 (miR-381) on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as the underlying potential mechanism. We found that CAT104 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma MG63 and OS-732 cells. Knockdown of CAT104 significantly inhibited OS-732 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. CAT104 regulated the expression of miR-381, and miR-381 participated in the effects of CAT104 on OS-732 cells. Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was a direct target gene of miR-381, which was involved in the regulatory roles of miR-381 in OS-732 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.

","Propofol is an intravenous sedative hypnotic agent of which the growth-inhibitory effect has been reported on various cancers. However, the roles of propofol in endometrial cancer (EC) remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of propofol on EC in vitro and in vivo. Different concentrations of propofol were used to treat Ishikawa cells. Colony number, cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were analyzed by colony formation, MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays. In addition, the pcDNA3.1-Sox4 and Sox4 siRNA plasmids were transfected into Ishikawa cells to explore the relationship between propofol and Sox4 in EC cell proliferation. Tumor weight in vivo was measured by xenograft tumor model assay. Protein levels of cell cycle-related factors, apoptosis-related factors, matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9), matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were examined by western blot. Results showed that propofol significantly decreased colony numbers, inhibited cell viability, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in Ishikawa cells. Moreover, propofol reduced the expression of Sox4 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, propofol significantly suppressed the proportions of Ki67+ cells, but Sox4 overexpression reversed the results. Furthermore, in vivo assay results showed that propofol inhibited tumor growth; however, the inhibitory effect was abolished by Sox4 overexpression. Moreover, propofol inhibited Sox4 expression via inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway. Our study demonstrated that propofol inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis by regulation of Sox4 in EC cells. These findings might indicate a novel treatment strategy for EC. "

However, the effect of SIN on glucocorticoids dermatitis has not been investigated. In our study, we aimed to explore the effect of SIN on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in HaCaT cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed an inflammatory injury model of LPS-induced HaCaT cells, then SIN was added to LPS-treated cells, cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors and inflammatory cytokines were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequently, miR-101 mimic and mimic control were transfected into HaCaT cells to investigate the effect of SIN and miR-101 on LPS-induced cells injury. Furthermore, MKP-1 and JNK signal pathways were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. Finally, the animal experiment was performed to further clarify the effect of SIN on inflammatoty injury. RESULTS: LPS suppressed cell viability, promoted apoptosis and increased IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha expressions and secretions in HaCaT cells.

In this study, we aimed to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of APS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation injury in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. H9c2 cells were treated with different concentrations of APS, and cell viability was detected by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Then, the effect of APS on cell viability and apoptosis induced by LPS was determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and western blot. The expression and release of inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, expression of miR-127 in H9c2 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and knocked down by transfection with miR-127 inhibitor. Western blot was used to analyze signaling pathway molecules. APS had no effect on H9c2 cells viability. However, APS could alleviate LPS-induced inflammation injury by increasing cell viability, reducing apoptosis, and inhibiting release of inflammatory cytokines in H9c2 cells ( P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that APS increased toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressions in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, we found that APS exerted the protective effect by down-regulating LPS-increased expression of miR-127 ( P < 0.05), inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), JNK and promoting phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathways in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. The results demonstrated that APS could protect H9c2 cells against LPS-induced inflammation injury, which might be partially due to miR-127 down-regulation and regulation of NF-kappaB, JNK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These findings indicated that APS might be a potential therapeutic drug for treatment of myocarditis. "

However, there is no effective treatment for curing this disease until now. Numerous studies reported that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to the pathogenesis of OA. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the effect of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury of ATDC5 cells. METHODS: Different concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10 mug/ml) of LPS were used to induce ATDC5 cells injury. The specific expressing vectors were then transfected into ATDC5 cells to alter MEG3, Sirt1 and miR-203 expressions. Flow cytometry, luciferase reporter, qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to detect cell viability, apoptosis, and the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha). Meanwhile, ELISA was used for analyzing the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in culture supernatant. Besides, the key pathways of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB were examined by western blot. RESULTS: LPS decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, promoted the release of pro-inflammatory factors, and down-regulated MEG3 expression, Moreover, MEG3 knockdown alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury. MEG3 acted as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) for miR-203, and MEG3 knockdown reduced inflammatory injury by regulating miR-203.

METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis and expression of inflammatory cytokines were all assessed to evaluate LPS-induce inflammatory injury. Expression of GAS5 in LPS-induced cells was evaluated by qRT-PCR. After cell transfection, effect of abnormally expressed GAS5 on LPS-induced inflammatory injury was determined. Then, the possible target of GAS5 was screened by bioinformatics and verified by qRT-PCR and luciferase activity assay. Together, whether aberrant expression of target gene affected the modulation of GAS5 in LPS-induced inflammatory injury was also assessed. Finally, the influences of aberrant expressed Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and Notch pathways were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: LPS reduced cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, along with down-regulation of GAS5. LPS-induced injury was alleviated by GAS5 overexpression while was exacerbated by GAS5 silence. KLF2 was predicted and verified as a target of GAS5, and GAS5 functioned through regulating expression of KLF2.

METHODS: Human OA chondrocytes (C28/12 cell line) were transfected with miR-302b inhibitor and miR-302b mimic to investigate the effects of miR-302b expression on chondrocyte apoptosis and inflammation, and to identify the miR-302b target proteins. RESULTS: LPS treatment of chondrocytes significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptotic rate. LPS treatment also increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines compared to control. miR-302b was up-regulated in LPS-induced chondrocytes. miR-302b was either suppressed or overexpressed in LPS-induced chondrocytes by transient transfection. miR-302b mimic transfection accelerated the effects of LPS on cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation. Of contrast, miR-302b inhibition represented a reverse effect. Dual luciferase activity demonstrated that Smad3 is a direct target for miR-302b and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-302b. In addition, miR-302b inhibition suppressed inflammation in LPS treated chondrocytes by up-regulating Smad3 expression. Moreover, LPS induced down-regulation of Notch and mTOR signaling pathway-related protein expressions, and miR-302b inhibition increased the expressions of Notch and mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins.

Clinical score of images of the eye fundus were taken on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after induction of EAU. The concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in intraocular fluid were measured at 14 days after EAU induction with the use of a multiplex assay system. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of CD4+, CD8+, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in spleen and lymph nodes. Western blotting was used to measure expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-related proteins in retina. Clinical scores for uveitis were lower in TGP-treated EAU mice than those without TGP treatment. Importantly, the concentrations of cytokines induced by T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells in intraocular fluid were reduced in EAU mice treated with TGP. Furthermore, the frequency of CD4+, IFN-gamma, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio was decreased and the frequency of CD8+ was increased in spleen and lymph nodes of mice treated with TGP. The anti-inflammatory effects of TGP were mediated by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathways. Our results showed that TGP suppressed uveitis in mice via the inhibition of Th1 and Th2 cell function. Thus, TGP may be a promising therapeutic strategy for uveitis, as well as other ocular inflammatory diseases. "

Different concentrations of IL-1beta (0, 0.1, 2, 5 and 10 ng/mL) were used to simulate inflammatory injury in CHON-001 cells. The expression of miR-126 was altered by transfection with miR-126 mimic. Thereafter, cells were treated with baicalin, and cell viability, apoptosis, the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and pro-inflammatory factors were respectively detected using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found that IL-1beta induced a significantly inflammatory injury in CHON-001 cells. Baicalin alleviated IL-1beta-induced inflammatory injury, as it increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis and repressed the production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. miR-126 was up-regulated by IL-1beta treatment while was down-regulated by baicalin. More interestingly, the protective actions of baicalin on IL-1beta-injured CHON-001 cells were partially eliminated by miR-126 overexpression. Further, NF-kappaB signaling pathway was activated by IL-1beta, and deactivated by addition of baicalin. The deactivation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway induced by baicalin upon IL-1beta exposure was recovered by miR-126 overexpression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that baicalin protected CHON-001 cells against IL-1beta-induced inflammatory injury possibly via down-regulation of miR-126 and thereby deactivation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Then, effects of ANRIL suppression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of U251 cells as well as expression of miR-34a were assessed. Meanwhile, effects of miR-34a on U251 cells silencing ANRIL were tested. Whether Sirt1 is a target of miR-34a was verified, followed by estimating the role of Sirt1 overexpression in U251 cells overexpressing miR-34a. Finally, the involved signaling pathways were assessed. ANRIL was upregulated in glioma cells and its suppression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted cell apoptosis. ANRIL acted as a sponge of miR-34a, and Sirt1 is a target of miR-34a. Then, Sirt1 was proved to function through activation of the PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways. In conclusion, ANRIL was upregulated in glioma, and its inhibition could repress cell proliferation, migration and invasion but inhibit cell apoptosis through miR-34a-mediated downregulation of Sirt1, involving the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways.

However, the drug resistance is almost inevitable. Increasing evidences suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) were associated with cancer chemo-resistance. Here, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of miR-103 affected resistance to ADR in AML cells. Different concentrations of ADR were used to induce K562 and KASUMI-1 cells, and miR-103 mimic, inhibitor were transfected into K562 and KASUMI-1 cells. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by trypan blue staining and MTT assays for evaluating K562 and KASUMI-1 cells drug resistance. The relationship of miR-103 and COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation, viability were detected again. Besides, the expressions of main factors of cell cycle and PI3K/AKT signal pathway were analyzed by Western blot. Results showed that ADR inhibited cell viability and proliferation in K562 and KASUMI-1 cells. However, K562 and KASUMI-1 cells appeared drug resistance for 50 passages at 0.8 microM of ADR. In addition, miR-103 expression was up-regulated in ADR-resistant K562 cells (K562/ADR) and overexpression of miR-103 increased K562 cells drug resistance via promoting cell viability and cell cycle-related factors expressions. COP1 was positively regulated by miR-103, suppression of miR-103 recovered K562/ADR cells drug resistance by regulation of COP1, Trib1, and C/EBPalpha. Besides, miR-103 blocked PI3K/AKT signal pathway by regulation of COP1. These data indicated that miR-103 was up-regulated in drug resistant cells and it may regulate ADR-resistance by regulation of COP1 in AML cells. "

METHODS: The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to test miR-145 expression in H9c2 cells with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-a abnormal expression under hypoxic condition. The 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Tran-swell assay and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effects of miR-145 on cell viability, migration and apoptosis under normoxic or hypoxic condition, respectively.

The role of several microRNAs (miRNAs) including miR-196b in different cancers has already been established. The study was aimed to explore the role of miR-196b in lung cancer and its possible underlying mechanism. METHODS: Human lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with miR-196b mimic, miR-196b inhibitor and corresponding controls. Then cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of A549 lung cancer cells either with overexpression or with suppression of miR-196b were estimated sequentially. Next, dual luciferase activity assay was performed to clarify whether Runx2 was a direct target of miR-196b. Finally, the expressions of main factors associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K/AKT/GSK3beta, Smad, and JNK pathways were detected by western blot.

Osteosarcoma cells with either overexpressed ZIC2 or suppressed ZIC2 were analyzed to determine cell viability, colony formation, and cell invasion. The expressions of SHIP2 and PI3K/AKT signal pathway-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot and qRT-PCR. We first showed that ZIC2 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma cells and tissues. Then we demonstrated that overexpression of ZIC2 promoted viability, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, whereas suppression of ZIC2 showed opposite effects. Furthermore, SHIP2 expression was negatively regulated by ZIC2. Importantly, ZIC2 overexpression activated the PI3K/AKT signal pathway; however, overexpressed SHIP2 inhibited these effects. Lastly, we showed that activation of the PI3K/AKT signal pathway is essential for the effects of ZIC2 on osteosarcoma cells, as the effects of ZIC2 on the osteosarcoma cells were reversed by a PI3K/AKT inhibitor.

The cerebral infarction rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After pretreatment with TSN, cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits score were evaluated, as well as cell apoptosis in hippocampus and cortex of the brain was examined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In addition, rat primary neuronal cells were isolated and cultured in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. After pretreatment with TSN, cell viability and apoptosis were observed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expressions of Bax and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Compared with untreated cerebral infarction rat, TSN treatment significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits score ( P < 0.05). Cell apoptosis as well as the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP in hippocampus and cortex of cerebral infarction rat were inhibited after pretreatment with TSN ( P < 0.05). Furthermore, TSN remarkably increased cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis ratio ( P < 0.05) in OGD-induced rat neuronal cells. Besides, TSN significantly downregulated the expression of Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 ( P < 0.05). TSN IIA has a preventive effect on cerebral infarction by inhibiting neuronal cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. "

","Osteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor with rapid progression, high metastatic potential and poor clinical prognosis. This study was aimed to investigate the function of miR-126 in OS cells. The miR-126 expression in OS cell lines and OS tissues were explored by qRT-PCR. Then, the effects of miR-126 on proliferation, cycle, migration, invasion, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed. Predicted by TargetScan, one of target genes for miR-126 was verified by luciferase activity assay. Meantime, the mRNA and protein expressions of ZEB1 were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. Subsequently, the effect of ZEB1 silence on miR-126 down-regulated cells was also evaluated. Finally, the expressions of key kinases involved in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-1/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 pathways were detected by Western blot analysis. Result showed that miR-126 was down-regulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-126 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and TGF-beta1 induced EMT. The effect of miR-126 knockdown was just the opposite. ZEB1 was predicted and verified as a target gene of miR-126. Meantime, the influence of miR-126 knockdown was abrogated by ZEB1 silence. Additionally, the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun, JNK, JAK1, and STAT3 were down-regulated in miR-126 over-expressed cells, and the effect of miR-126 knockdown was reversed by ZEB1 silence. In conclusion, miR-126 inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in OS by targeting ZEB1 through inactivation of JNK and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3765-3774, 2017.

We established LPS-induced septic acute kidney injury (AKI) model in HK-2 cells. LPS-induced HK-2 cells were transfected with pc-PVT1, pc-NC, si-PVT1 or si-NC. Cell viability and apoptosis rate were detected by MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit, respectively. The relationships of PVT1 and inflammatory factors were evaluated by RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. The levels of inflammatory factors, apoptosis-related proteins and the expressions of proteins related to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway were detected by ELISA or Western blotting. Compared with cells with pc-NC, cell viability was remarkably decreased and cell apoptosis rate was increased in LPS-induced cells with pc-PVT1 (p<0.05). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta were significantly increased in LPS-induced cells with pc-PVT1 compared with cells with pc-NC (p<0.05). All these changes were reversed in LPS-induced cells with si-PVT1 and si-NC (p<0.05). RTP assay revealed that PVT1 could bind to TNF-alpha. Furthermore, down-regulated PVT1 remarkably reduced the expressions of p-JNK and p-c-Jun, p-IkappaBalpha and p-p65 (p<0.05); while increased expressions of these proteins and inflammatory factors induced by up-regulated PVT1 were reversed by JNK or NF-kappaB inhibitors. PVT1 may promote inflammatory response by binding to TNF-alpha and inhibiting JNK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in LPS-induced septic AKI cells. "

This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-21 in osteosarcoma. The level of miR-21 in 20 pairs of osteosarcoma and corresponding adjacent tissues was monitored by qPCR. Human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 was transfected with either miR-21 mimic or miR-21 inhibitor, and then cell viability, survival, and apoptosis were measured by MTT, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. A target of miR-21 was predicted by the microRNA.org database and verified in vitro by using luciferase reporter, qPCR, and Western blot analyses. Finally, cells were cotransfected with siRNA against caspase 8 and miR-21 inhibitor, and the apoptotic cell rate was determined again. Results showed that the mRNA level of miR-21 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Overexpression of miR-21 improved cell viability and survival but suppressed apoptosis. Caspase 8 was a direct target of miR-21, and it was negatively regulated by miR-21. Moreover, miR-21 suppression attenuated caspase 8 silencing and induced the decrease in apoptosis. In conclusion, overexpression of miR-21 suppressed SAOS-2 cell apoptosis via directly targeting caspase 8. "

Expression of miR-182 in both cancer and peripheral blood samples was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Human RCC line Caki-1 cells were transfected with miR-182 mimic, miR-182 inhibitor, or negative controls, and then the cell viability, colony-formation ability, migration, and invasion assay were determined. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine whether insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) was a target of miR-182. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against IGF1R was co-transfected with miR-182 inhibitor into cells, and then the effects on migration and invasion were assessed. MiR-182 was down-regulated in both cancer and blood samples compared to the matched non-tumor adjacent tissues and healthy volunteers, respectively (both P<0.05). Compared to the control group, cell viability, colony-forming ability, and numbers of migrated and invaded cells were significantly decreased by transfection with miR-182 mimic but were markedly increased by miR-182 inhibitor (all P < 0.05). Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that IGF1R was a target gene of miR-182, and IGF1R was negatively regulated by miR-182. Co-transfection of miR-182 inhibitor with si-IGF1R reversed the effect of miR-182 inhibitor on the migration and invasion of the cells. MiR-182 functions as an anti-oncogene in ccRCC, and miR-182-mediated inhibition of cell migration and invasion might be through directly targeting IGF1R. "
